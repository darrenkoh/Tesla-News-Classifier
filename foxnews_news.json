(note: most electric cars, like teslas, don't technically use gears or transmissions, but the terms remain in use when describing their operation.). the model s and x are also being advertised with a yoke-style steering wheel, but according to a redditor who claims to have been in the new model s, they are currently being shipped with a traditional round wheel until nhtsa approves the yoke, at which time owners will be able to get it retrofitted into their new cars. tesla has not officially confirmed the status of the wheel.",

(343 industries). musk has previously said that the sci-fi-style cybertruck was inspired by video games like halo, which includes the m12 warthog fast attack vehicle. but the united nations space command has plenty of other futuristic military vehicles at its disposal, including the m9 main anti-aircraft tank, aka: the warthog. however, the 25-foot long surface-to-air missile-equipped half-track is bigger than the 19' 4\" cybertruck, so that's probably not it. in the real world, the u.s. military has a gigantic bridge layer called the wolverine that's even larger than the halo vehicle, but there's a much older military truck that might be closer to what musk has in mind. istock/rweisswald. the m151 was first built by ford for the u.s. military in 1959 as a successor to the willys mb and mc, but was customized and modernized in 1975 by a specialty vehicle fabrication company in florida and sold under the wolverine name. at just about 11 feet long, it's perhaps too small for tesla's requirement, but turn it into a four-door and put a bed on it and you practically end up with a jeep gladiator-sized midsize truck. perfect. (classic car studio). classic car studio owner noah alexander, who recently handled one for a client, told fox news autos that records about warthog production have largely disappeared, but from what he was able to dig up, they were apparently built in small quantities for both military and civilian use, with most having been shipped to foreign countries. could one of them have made its way to musk's boyhood home of pretoria, south africa, and imprinted itself in his mind as an iconically cool truck? technically speaking, it's possible. the yamaha wolverine isn't a truck, but it is a popular line of side-by-sides, also known as utility task vehicles or utvs. this is the most likely candidate for what musk was thinking about, because tesla has experience with the brand ... unofficially. the electric cyberquad it debuted with the cybertruck last november was later discovered to be converted yamaha 700 raptor atv that the powersports company said it didn't have any involvement with. (fox). of course, the first thing that comes to most people's minds when you say \"wolverine\" these days is hugh jackman's depiction of the marvel character in the x-men films, and you don't have to look any further than the jacked actor to find an example of a \"tight wolverine.\". .",

        "body": "tesla smashes into overturned truck while on autopilot, report says. traffic cameras captured the moment when a tesla slammed into an overturned cargo truck in taiwan early monday morning. the white model 3 is seen in the fast lane approaching the white truck lying across the highway, as another vehicle slows and drives around it. according to local media, the driver was uninjured and told emergency responders that the car was in autopilot mode, but did not have its more full self-driving capability feature engaged. autopilot is advertised with the ability to steer the car within a lane and brake for vehicles and other obstacles, while full-self driving can execute lane-changes and other advanced maneuvers. the driver reportedly told authorities that he saw the truck and manually hit the brakes too late to avoid the crash, which is apparently indicated on the video by a puff of white smoke coming from the tires. tesla, which has the ability to collect operational data from its customer vehicles, has not yet commented on the incident. it's not clear at what point autopilot should have engaged the brakes itself. autopilot was previously involved in two fatal accidents in florida, when model s sedans failed to recognize and stop in time for tractor-trailers crossing highways. in may, tesla ceo elon musk predicted that by the end of this year the evolving full self-driving feature will allow a car to drive itself from an owner's home to their office \"most of the time with no interventions,\" and that the feature, which currently costs $7,000 in the u.s., will be worth $100,000 when full autonomy is achieved. .",

        "body": "chuck devore: elon musk's tesla to texas? calif. business exodus may shift into high gear because of this. tesla founder and ceo elon musk threatened to move his company headquarters and manufacturing plant, california's sole remaining auto factory, out of state - to texas and nevada. neither texas nor nevada has an individual income tax and their corporate taxes are lower, as well. with california's higher taxes, greater red tape compliance costs, higher labor and land costs, and more litigious environment, business analysts estimate that companies can save 32 percent of their operating costs by moving out of california to states such as texas. liz peek: coronavirus reopening - democrats resist, americans persist. here's why. california gov. gavin newsom, a democrat, gave the clearance for manufacturers in california to reopen on friday, but alameda county has extended its local shutdown order indefinitely. the county lockdown order brought musk's frustration into the open, as it prevents his flagship fremont assembly line from reopening. the fremont location has manufactured cars since 1916 for chevrolet, general motors and then a gm-toyota joint venture from 1984 to 2010. tesla took over the location in 2010. it's now california's last remaining automobile manufacturing facility. musk announced via twitter that \"tesla is filing a lawsuit against alameda county immediately. the unelected & ignorant 'interim health officer' of alameda is acting contrary to the governor, the president, our constitutional freedoms & just plain common sense!\". musk continued, \"frankly, this is the final straw. tesla will now move its hq and future programs to texas/nevada immediately. if we even retain fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen (sic) on how tesla is treated in the future. tesla is the last carmaker left in ca.\". musk appears to be channeling his inner davy crockett, who after losing his campaign to get reelected to congress in 1834 said \"...you may all go to hell and i will go to texas.\". if california does enact a series of tax increases, it may well accelerate the economic damage done by the virus from wuhan, china.. in response to musk, democrat san diego lawmaker lorena gonzalez tweeted \"f*ck elon musk\" saturday night. texas immediately welcomed musk to move, with sen. ted cruz tweeting, \"come to texas! we would welcome tesla hq in texas. we love jobs & texans very much want to open up & get back to work (while still staying safe & following sound science). we make lots of cars & trucks in texas, and we'd love more!!\". california can ill-afford to chase away more jobs in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. even before the virus hit, a longtime california commercial real estate developer, john ghiselli, saw california's deepening financial crunch as likely to lead to further tax increases. he moved to texas last year and has created a company - waterloo capital private equity - that will arrange financing to move companies out of california. ghiselli is certain he'll get a healthy return on his investment because the average business that relocates out of california will reduce its operating costs by 32 percent. business relocation expert joe vranich, also a former californian, published a study last year showing 13,000 businesses left california over the past eight years. click here to get the opinion newsletter. with widespread government restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the virus, california's finances plunged from a multibillion-dollar surplus to a $54.3 billion shortfall, 46 percent higher than it was at the peak of the great recession. california, with its nation-high income tax, is heavily dependent on wealthier taxpayers, yet its dominant political class tends to excoriate job creators. california lawmakers returned last monday to the capitol, where they are likely going to vote to approve a series of heavy tax increases. in addition, voters will consider two ballot initiatives this november to hike property taxes up to $12.5 billion per year on commercial properties, a whopping 20 percent increase in overall state property taxes. if california does enact a series of tax increases, it may well accelerate the economic damage done by the virus from wuhan, china. in contrast, texas republican gov. greg abbott and key lawmakers are said to be preparing to scrub texas' budget for billions in savings while holding the $10 billion in their rainy day account in reserve. if california further hikes taxes while texas holds the line, look for an increased exodus of jobs and people from the golden state to the lone star state. click here to read more by chuck devore.",

        "body": "new tesla feature slows for red and green lights. after testing on public roads, tesla is rolling out a new feature of its partially automated driving system designed to spot stop signs and traffic signals. the update of the electric car company's cruise control and auto-steer systems is a step toward ceo elon musk's pledge to convert cars to fully self-driving vehicles later this year. but it also runs contrary to recommendations from the u.s. national transportation safety board that include limiting where tesla's autopilot driving system can operate because it has failed to spot and react to hazards in at least three fatal crashes. in a note sent to a group of tesla owners who were picked to test the stop light and sign recognition feature, the company said it can be used with the traffic aware cruise control or autosteer systems. the feature will slow the car whenever it detects a traffic light, including those that are green or blinking yellow. it will notify the driver of its intent to slow down and stop, and drivers must push down the gear selector and press the accelerator pedal to confirm that it's safe to proceed. the company warns in the note obtained by the associated press that drivers must pay attention and be ready to take immediate action \"including braking because this feature may not stop for all traffic controls.\". the note says that over time, as the system learns from the fleet on the roads, it \"will control more naturally.\". tesla didn't respond to multiple requests for additional details, but the website electrek.co reported last week that the new feature is being sent to the wider tesla fleet as part of an over-the-internet software update for thousands of vehicles. the feature won't come until later in other parts of the world, the website said. the national highway traffic safety administration, the u.s. government's road safety agency, said in a prepared statement monday that the agency \"will closely monitor the performance of this technology,\" adding that drivers must be ready to act and law enforcement agencies will hold them responsible. elon musk says the cybertruck can float. jason levine, executive director of the center for auto safety, a nonprofit watchdog group, said tesla is using the feature to sell cars and get media attention, even though it might not work. \"unfortunately, we'll find out the hard way,\" he said. whenever one of its vehicles using autopilot is involved in a crash, tesla points to \"legalese\" warning drivers that they have to pay attention, levine said. but he said tesla drivers have a history over-relying on the company's electronics. missy cummings, a robotics and human factors professor at duke university, fears that a tesla will fail to stop for a traffic light and a driver won't be paying attention. she also said tesla is using its customers for \"free testing\" of new software. she also fears that the cars will stop for green lights and their drivers won't react in time to keep moving, causing more rear-end collisions. the ntsb has ruled in three fatal crashes that tesla's autopilot system was partly to blame, and it has expressed frustration with nhtsa for failing to act on the board's recommendations. last month the board, which has no regulatory powers, took the unusual step of accusing nhtsa of contributing to the cause of a march 2019 tesla crash in florida. the march 1, 2019, crash in delray beach, florida, killed the 50-year-old driver of a tesla model 3. the car was traveling 69 miles per hour (111 kilometers per hour) when neither the driver nor the autopilot system braked or tried to avoid a tractor-trailer that was crossing in its path. the car struck the trailer, which sheared off the tesla's roof. the report also blamed the truck and the tesla driver in the crash. ntsb chairman robert sumwalt said in march that the crash was the third \"where a driver's overreliance on tesla's autopilot and the operational design of tesla's autopilot have led to tragic consequences.\". nhtsa said it will review the ntsb's report. the delray beach crash was remarkably similar to one in 2016 in williston, florida, which also killed a tesla driver. in that crash neither autopilot nor the driver stopped for a crossing tractor-trailer. tesla maintains that its vehicles operating on autopilot are about twice as safe as those in which the system isn't engaged. the company says in the fourth quarter, drivers using autopilot had one crash for every 3.07 million miles driven. .",

(ntsb). chairman robert sumwalt said at the start of a hearing tuesday that systems like tesla's autopilot cannot drive themselves, yet drivers continue to use them without paying attention. \"if you own a car with partial automation, you do not own a self-driving car,\" sumwalt said in opening statements. \"this means that when driving in the supposed 'self-driving' mode, you can't read a book, you can't watch a movie or tv show, you can't text and you can't play video games.\". the board will determine a cause of the crash at the hearing and make recommendations to prevent it from happening again. sumwalt says government regulators have ignored the board's previous recommendations for measures to prevent these crashes. tesla owner complained about autopilot before fatal crash. the march 2018 crash involving a tesla model x suv killed apple engineer walter huang when it swerved and slammed into a concrete barrier dividing freeway and exit lanes in mountain view, calif. just before the crash, the tesla steered to the left into a paved area between the freeway travel lanes and an exit ramp, the ntsb said. it accelerated to 71 mph and crashed into the end of the concrete barrier. the car's forward collision avoidance system didn't alert huang, and its automatic emergency braking did not activate, the ntsb said. also, huang did not brake, and there was no steering movement detected to avoid the crash, the board's staff said. ntsb investigators previously found that tesla's system became confused at a freeway exit and was a factor in the crash. documents released earlier this month quoted huang's relatives as saying huang had previously complained about autopilot malfunctioning and swerving in the area near where crash occurred. autopilot is designed to keep a vehicle in its lane and keep a safe distance from vehicles in front of it. it also can change lanes with driver approval. tesla says autopilot is intended to be used for driver assistance and that drivers must be ready to intervene at all times. nhtsa looking into tesla unintended acceleration complaints. ntsb staff determined that tesla's system does not adequately make sure drivers are paying attention and recommended that stronger driver monitoring systems be required. sumwalt said the board had made recommendations to six automakers in 2017 to stop the problem and only tesla has failed to respond. teslas can sense a driver applying force to the steering wheel, and if that doesn't happen, it will issue visual and audio warnings. but monitoring steering wheel torque, \"is a poor surrogate measure\" of monitoring the driver, ensar becic, the ntsb's human performance and automation highway safety expert told the board. messages were left tuesday afternoon seeking comment from tesla. under questioning from board members, robert molloy, the ntsb's director of highway safety, said the national highway traffic safety administration is taking a hands-off approach to regulating new automated driving systems like autopilot. molloy called the approach \"misguided,\" and said nothing is more disappointing than seeing recommendations ignored by tesla and nhtsa. the ntsb can only make recommendations, while nhtsa is the agency charged with making regulations. \"they need to do more,\" he said of the federal highway safety agency. more tesla news. nhtsa has told the ntsb it has investigations open into 14 tesla crashes and would use its enforcement of safety defects to take action if needed. the agency issued a statement saying it will review the ntsb's report and that all commercially available vehicles require human drivers to stay in control at all times. \"distraction-affected crashes are a major concern, including those involving advanced driver assistance features,\" the statement said. sumwalt said the ntsb had called for technology more than nine years ago to disable distracting functions of smartphones while the user is driving, but no action has been taken. don karol, the ntsb's project manager for highway safety, told the board that the staff is recommending that cell phone companies program phones to automatically lock out distracting functions such as games and phone calls while someone is driving. the staff also recommends that companies enact policies to prevent use of company issued cell phones while workers are driving. \"lockout mechanisms should be default setting and should automatically lock out distracting functions,\" karol told the board. tesla has said autopilot was put out initially in \"beta,\" meaning it was being tested and improved as bugs were identified, karol told the board. that brought a response from vice chairman bruce landsburg, who said if the system has known bugs, \"it's probably pretty foreseeable that somebody's going to have a problem with it. and then they (tesla) come back and say 'oh, we warned you.'\".",

(toyota). toyota corolla (range: $19,600 - $25,550): the corolla sedan is all-new for 2020 and cr praised it for its ride quality, fuel efficiency and standard technology, which includes adaptive radar cruise control. (subaru). subaru forester (range: $24,495 - $34,595): cr likes the small suvs practicality -- which includes great visibility, large doors and hip-high seats that make it easy to enter -- and high owner satisfaction. subaru legacy (range: $22,745 - $35,895): the new for 2020 is one of cr's top scorers in every category, has plenty of room, a \"solid\" feel, good ride and standard all-wheel-drive. toyota prius/prius prime (range: $24,325 - $32,500): toyota's venerable hybrid marks its 17th time on the list thanks to a 52 mpg result in fuel economy testing, a 22.5-mile all-electric range for the plug-in prime model and excellent expected reliability.

        "body": "tesla owner complained about autopilot before fatal crash. an apple engineer who died when his tesla model x hit a concrete barrier on a silicon valley freeway had complained before his death that the suv's autopilot system would malfunction in the area where the crash happened. (ntsb). the complaints were detailed in a trove of documents released tuesday by the u.s. national transportation safety board, which is investigating the march 2018 crash that killed engineer walter huang. the documents say huang told his wife that autopilot had previously veered his suv toward the same barrier on u.s. 101 near mountain view, calif. where he later crashed. huang died at a hospital from his injuries. \"walter said the car would veer toward the barrier in the mornings when he went to work,\" the huang family's attorney wrote in a response to ntsb questions. huang also described autopilot's malfunctioning to his brother, the attorney wrote, in addition to talking with a friend who owns a model x. huang, a software engineer, discussed with the friend how a patch to the autopilot software affected its performance and made the model x veer, the lawyer's response said. sometime prior to the crash, huang took his tesla to a service center to fix a \"navigation error,\" the attorney's response said. but tesla could not duplicate the problem and it was not repaired. the huang family is suing tesla and california's department of transportation for allegedly failing to maintain the highway. autopilot is a partially automated system designed to keep a vehicle in its lane and keep a safe distance from vehicles in front of it. it also can change lanes with driver approval. tesla says autopilot is intended for driver assistance and that drivers must be ready to intervene at all times. the full ntsb board is scheduled to hold a hearing on the crash on feb. 25. at that time, it will determine a cause and make safety recommendations. ntsb staff members have already recommended that california transportation officials move faster to repair highway safety barriers damaged by vehicles. a report from the agency says california officials failed to fix the barrier that was damaged in a crash 11 days before huang was killed. in that incident, a 2010 toyota prius traveling in excess of 75 mph (120 kmh) crashed against the attenuator, a cushion that protects vehicles from hitting the end of concrete lane dividers. the 31-year-old driver survived the crash and was treated for relatively minor injuries, the ntsb said. the california highway patrol responded to the march 12 crash but did not notify the california department of transportation of the damage as it is required to, the ntsb said. huang's 2017 tesla model x was traveling at 71 mph (114 kph) when it crashed against the same attenuator, which the ntsb determined had been damaged and repaired more frequently than any other left-exit in caltrans' district 4, which includes all of the san francisco bay area, a region of 7 million people. in the three years before the tesla crash, the device was struck at least five times, including one crash that resulted in fatalities. a car struck it again on may 20, 2018, about two months after the tesla crash, the ntsb said. california department of transportation spokesman matt rocco said the department is reviewing the ntsb report to determine its next steps but declined to answer questions. \"safety remains caltrans top priority,\" he said. also on tuesday, the ntsb released documents from another fatal tesla crash, this one on march 1, 2019 in delray beach, florida. in that incident, driver jeremy banner turned on the autopilot function of his model 3 sedan 10 seconds before the crash, then took his hands off the steering wheel, ntsb documents said. the car then drove underneath a tractor-trailer that was crossing in front of it, sheering off the car's roof and killing banner. it was eerily similar to another florida crash in 2016 in which a tesla on autopilot went beneath a semi-trailer. nhtsa looking into tesla unintended acceleration complaints. the ntsb said in a preliminary report that it still hasn't determined the cause of the crash. according to the report, traffic was light on the four-lane highway and dawn was breaking when banner, 50, set his speed at 69 mph (111 kph) and activated the autopilot as he headed to work. the speed limit was 55 mph (88 kph). seconds later, a tractor-trailer driven by richard wood, 45, pulled from a driveway and began to cross to the other side of the highway. wood said he saw two sets of car headlights coming toward him, but he thought he had time to make it across. \"it was dark and it looked like the cars was back further than they was,\" wood told ntsb investigators four days after the crash. a photo taken by the ntsb from tesla's front-end video camera showed wood's trailer fully blocking the road 1.5 seconds before the crash. data from the tesla's computer shows that banner hit his brakes less than a second before the crash, but the car went under the trailer. wood says he saw a second car but that one didn't hit the trailer. palm beach county firefighters who arrived minutes later found the tesla about a quarter-mile (400 meters) down the highway with its engine running. the car had automatically shifted to neutral and turned on its emergency flashers when its computer detected the crash. they said that they had never dealt with a tesla's ignition before and didn't know how to turn it off - that requires using a keycard. the department has since given its firefighters additional training.",

(tesla). tesla's cybertruck may have gotten the headlines this year, but the model y trucklet will be the next new model it puts on sale. the compact utility vehicle is based on the model 3 sedan and equipped with a battery pack that's good for 300 miles per charge in the $48,000 long range rear-wheel-drive version that will be the most affordable model y when it enters production mid-year. rivian r1t. (rivian). startup electric truck company rivian raised nearly $3 billion from the likes of amazon, ford, cox automotive and t. rowe price in 2019 and is set to launch its first battery-powered pickup by the end of 2020. the luxurious midsize r1t has a starting price of $69,000 and comes with an adjustable air suspension system, four-motor all-wheel-drive and the ability to spin in place like a tank. top models will offer 400 miles of range, 750 hp, 0-60 mph acceleration in 3.0 seconds and a max tow rating of 11,000 pounds. .",

(wsvn). \"during that operation, modules that had separated from the battery ignited on the tow truck when workers passed a chain over them,\" the ntsb report stated. the fires extinguished by themselves, but when the car was loaded onto a different truck, the battery caught fire again and had to be put out by the fire department. when the battery and modules were being unloaded at the tow yard, the case and modules reignited once again, but the fire burned itself out, according to the report. (ntsb). the youths were returning from a trip to a nearby mall when the crash occurred on a road with a 30 mph speed limit and a sign warning drivers to go 25 mph around the curve, the report said. the tesla was going 116 mph. the driver lost control while passing another vehicle, according to the report. the high-performance version of the model s hit a curb and a wall, and the battery caught fire, it said. the driver was given the car at the end of 2017, and got a ticket in march of 2018 for driving it 112 mph on a road with a 50 mph speed limit, according to the report. (ntsb). after the ticket, the youth's father stopped him from driving the car and asked tesla if it could restrict the car's speed. employees at a tesla store put the vehicle into \"loaner\" mode, limiting it to 85 mph. but in april ,tesla restored the car to normal speed mode at the request of the teen, who was able to make service decisions on the car, the report stated. batteries like those used by tesla and other electric cars can catch fire and burn rapidly in a crash, although tesla has said its vehicles catch fire far less often than those powered by gasoline. .",

        "body": "the tesla cybertruck will be a medium duty truck, report says. the tesla cybertruck may be even bigger than it looks. automotive news has uncovered a letter sent by tesla to the california air resources board in support of a stronger mandate for zero-emissions truck sales in the state that revealed the automaker expects the cybertruck to be certified as a class 2b to 3 medium-duty truck. that would put it in the same segments as the ford f-250 and f-350, rather than the light-duty f-150 elon musk often compares it to and pitted against in a controversial tug of war. (tesla). trucks are classified by their gross vehicle weight ratings, which combines their own weight and the maximum amount of payload they can carry.  class 2b trucks run from 8,501 to 10,000 pounds and class 3 trucks from 10,001 to 14,000 pounds. elon musk spotted hitting the town -- and a sign -- in the tesla cybertruck. tesla said the cybertruck will be able to carry up to 3,500 pounds and tow over 14,000 pounds. considering that the smaller tesla model x suv weighs over 5,100 pounds, even the same empty weight with that sort of payload rating would push it into class 2b. however, when equipped with the large battery pack that will be required to provide the 500 miles of range projected in the top of the line tri motor cybertruck, a weight above 6,500 pounds is not out of the question, and common in medium-duty trucks with similar capabilities. a class 2b or 3 rating would also exempt the truck from epa range and efficiency testing. most automakers decline to reveal exact fuel economy projections for trucks this big. it's not clear from the letter if all three of the cybertruck models announced, including the entry-level two-wheel-drive version, will be medium duty. fox news autos asked tesla in november if they would be sold as a light or medium-duty trucks, but the company never responded. musk has also not followed up on a promise to redo the tug of war after many people, including celebrity scientist neil degrasse tyson, pointed out that the ford ford f-150 model used was not equally matched to the cybertruck. musk tweeted on nov. 25 that he was aiming to webcast a second matchup the following week, but it has yet to happen. for the record, and potential tale of the tape, while the f-150 can be configured to pull up to 13,200 pounds, the 2020 f-250 has a maximum conventional tow rating of 20,000 pounds. .",

        "body": "elon musk cleared in 'pedo guy' defamation trial. elon musk defeated defamation allegations friday from a british cave explorer who claimed he was branded a pedophile when the tesla ceo called him \"pedo guy\" in an angry tweet. (ap). vernon unsworth, who participated in the rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach trapped for weeks in a thailand cave last year, had sought $190 million in damages for the shame and humiliation caused by the man his lawyer called a \"billionaire bully.\". it took less than an hour for an eight-person jury in los angeles federal court to reject unsworth's claim after a four-day trial. musk said the verdict restored his faith in humanity as he quickly left the court with his security detail. musk - who deleted the tweet and later apologized for it - had asserted the expression was nothing more than a flippant insult that meant \"creepy old man,\" not pedophile. unsworth had provoked the attack by belittling musk's contribution to the rescue -- a miniature sub his engineers built that was never used -- as ineffective and nothing more than a \"pr stunt.\" he further earned the ire of the tech whiz by suggesting musk stick the sub \"where it hurts.\". on friday, it was unsworth who felt the pain. \"i accept the jury verdict, take it on the chin, and move on,\" unsworth said outside court. jury foreman joshua jones said the panel decided unsworth's lawyers failed to prove their case. he said they spent too much time trying to appeal to jurors' emotions and not concentrating on the evidence. \"the failure probably happened because they didn't focus on the tweets,\" jones said after the verdict was announced. \"i think they tried to get our emotions involved in it.\". attorney lin wood, in an impassioned and at times emotional closing argument, suggested the jury should award $190 million. wood said $150 million of that figure should be a \"hard slap on the wrist\" to punish musk for what he said was akin to dropping an atomic weapon on his client that would create problems for years like radioactive fallout. he suggested the figure would be reasonable given that musk testified his stock in tesla and spacex is worth about $20 billion. but musk's lawyer, alex spiro, ridiculed the suggested verdict as \"numbers being thrown out like 'the price is right.'\". wood said it was important to challenge musk's tweet in court even if they didn't win. unsworth had said the statement would appear true if he didn't sue. \"anybody that knows this man knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that elon's accusations were false,\" wood said outside court. \"this was not the justice that he deserved under the evidence.\". while musk was cleared of liability, the trial was just the latest incident where he's faced legal problems because of troublesome tweets. musk and tesla reached a $40 million settlement with the securities and exchange commission last year over allegations he misled investors with a tweet declaring he had secured financing to buy out the electric car maker. earlier this year, the sec sought to hold him in contempt of court for tweeting a misleading projection of how many cars tesla would manufacture. that led to a new agreement imposing tight controls on musk's tweets about the company. the day after musk's tweet about unsworth, tesla stock price fell 3% and shareholders and people within the company were urging him to apologize. musk said he resisted at first because he didn't want to look \"foolish and craven\" by doing so right after the stock dropped. musk's lawyer told the jury the tweet did not rise to the level of defamation and cases over insults didn't belong in federal courtrooms. spiro said unsworth had tried to profit off his role in the cave rescue and basked in the many accolades he received. unsworth had been honored by the queen of england and the king of thailand, had his photo taken next to british prime minister theresa may and been asked to speak at schools and contribute to a children's book, which showed that no one took musk's insult seriously. \"people accused of pedophilia don't get celebrated by world leaders,\" spiro said. \"kings and queens and prime ministers don't stand next to pedophiles.\". unsworth hadn't demonstrated actual damage to his reputation other than asserting over a couple minutes of emotional testimony delivered with his voice cracking that he felt isolated, ashamed and dirtied, spiro said. there was no supporting testimony from his girlfriend or other friends who could discuss the impact they witnessed, no evidence he had lost business or relationships as a result of the tweet and he hadn't sought psychological counseling or medication. spiro mocked unsworth's claims that the tweet was like a life sentence without parole, noting that many people are serving such terms in actual prisons. he urged jurors to return a verdict that would make clear no reasonable person would conclude musk had called him a pedophile. \"tell mr. unsworth once and for all, 'you are not a pedophile,' \" spiro said. \"with our verdict, we free you, we free you from parole.\". .",

(ap). the tesla ceo returns to the witness stand wednesday after spending several hours at his defamation trial trying to dance around the meaning of the \"pedo guy\" tweet he aimed at vernon unsworth, a cave diver who helped rescue a dozen boys and their soccer coach from a flooded thailand cave last year. musk said the insult meant only \"creepy old man\" and did not literally mean he was calling unsworth a pedophile. the spat began when unsworth ridiculed musk's effort in the rescue by having engineers at his companies, including space x and the boring co., develop a mini-submarine that could transport the boys to safety. despite working around the clock to build the sub in short order, musk arrived in thailand late in the rescue effort and the craft was never used. unsworth called it nothing more than a \"pr stunt\" and said musk could stick the sub \"where it hurts.\" musk watched the cnn clip of unsworth several times before lashing out in a series of tweets july 15, 2018.

(tesla). the electric pickup's unconventional style features sci-fi-inspired elements that include an angular body with slab sides and a windshield that stretches from a peak above the driver's head to a full-width headlight bar in a continuous plane, without a conventional hood. a similar flat surface slopes rearward to the top of the tailgate and incorporates a retractable cover for the bed. (tesla). musk said the truck's body is constructed with a dent and scratch-resistant high strength stainless steel \"exoskeleton\" that was demonstrated by someone hitting it with a sledgehammer without damaging it, along with photos showing its ability to stop a 9mm bullet. the truck's so-called tesla armor glass didn't fare as well and shattered when a small metal ball was thrown at it on stage. (tesla). the cybertruck will be offered in three versions, starting with a $39,900 entry-level model that has rear-wheel-drive, a 250-mile per-charge range, 7,500-pound tow rating and a 0-60 mph acceleration time of 6.5 seconds. a $49,900 dual motor all-wheel-drive model increases the range to 300 miles, the tow rating to 10,000 pounds and reduces the 0-60 mph time to 4.5 seconds. at the top of the lineup is a $69,900 tri motor all-wheel-drive model with twin rear electric motors that can go 500 miles, tow 14,000 pounds, accelerate to 60 mph in 2.9 seconds and cover a quarter-mile in a supercar-quick 10.8 seconds. (tesla). all cybertrucks will be equipped with tesla's autopilot driving aid and the hardware needed to activate the tesla's full self-driving system, which remains a work in progress. they will also come standard with a computer-controlled air suspension system that can lower the vehicle for entry and highway driving and raise it to give it 16 inches of ground clearance for off-roading.

(tesla). tesla is now taking reservations for the cybertruck with a $100 deposit and deliveries of the rear-wheel-drive and dual-motor versions are expected to begin in late 2021 at a yet-to-be-revealed location. competing electric pickup startups rivian and lordstown motors expect to have their first trucks on sale by the end of 2020, and just prior to the tesla event, general motors ceo mary barra confirmed that gm will begin building one of its own at the same time the cybertruck is scheduled to go into production. tesla's consumer website says the tri motor cybertruck will be added in late 2022. .",

(tesla). the feature is called smart summon and is designed to allow a tesla owner to retrieve their vehicle remotely, using an app. with it, the cars are supposed to be able to drive themselves autonomously through parking lots to their owners while sticking to lanes and avoiding vehicles, pedestrians and other obstacles. tesla cautions that operators should only use it if the vehicle is in their line of sight and that they should be prepared to stop it quickly. following its wide release last week, tesla owners started posting reports and videos of it in action to social media. while it has worked well for many, much to their delight, there have been several alleged incidents involving off-pavement excursions, close calls and collisions that have raised concerns. a nhtsa spokesperson told reuters that it is aware of reports related to tesla's summon feature. \"we are in ongoing contact with the company and we continue to gather information. safety is nhtsa's top priority and the agency will not hesitate to act if it finds evidence of a safety-related defect,\" the spokesperson said. tesla has not commented on nhtsa's actions, but company ceo elon musk tweeted on wednesday that over 550,000 people had used smart summon and added that a smart parking feature will follow in one or two months, but that it might be \"a little silly at first.\". tesla's operating system allows the company to modify features using over-the-air updates. click here for the all-new foxbusiness.com.",

(culver city firefighters local 1927). the national transportation safety board said tuesday the driver never saw the parked firetruck and didn't brake. apparently the man's 2014 tesla model s didn't brake either. the report raises further questions about the effectiveness of tesla's system, which was in operation before several other crashes including two fatalities in florida and one in silicon valley. tesla warns drivers that the system is not fully autonomous and drivers must be ready to intervene. the ntsb report didn't state a cause of the crash. the agency will issue a final report wednesday. click here for the fox news app. the driver in the jan. 22, 2018 firetruck crash on interstate 405 was not hurt. but the ntsb report says he did not have his hands on the steering wheel at the time of the crash. the firetruck from culver city, california, had stopped in the northbound high occupancy vehicle lane with its emergency lights flashing as it responded to another crash. the firefighters were also uninjured. the tesla driver, from suburban woodland hills, told the ntsb that he was traveling to work in los angeles when the crash happened. he told investigators he was looking forward with his hand rested on his knee while touching the bottom of the steering wheel. just before the crash, a large vehicle, an suv or pickup truck, changed lanes in front of him, the driver told the ntsb. \"although the driver stated that he was looking forward, he was unable to see the firetruck in time enough to avoid the crash. the driver had coffee and a bagel at the time, but he wasn't sure if either was in his hand when the crash occurred,\" according to the report. cellphone data showed the driver was not using his phone to talk or text in the minutes leading up to the crash. a statement from a driver in a nearby vehicle provided by tesla said the driver appeared to be looking down at a cellphone or other device he was holding in his left hand before the crash. the ntsb determined in september 2017 that design limitations of the tesla model s autopilot played a major role in a may 2016 fatal crash in florida involving a vehicle operating under autopilot. but it blamed the crash on an inattentive tesla driver's overreliance on technology and a truck driver who made a left turn in front of the car. the california investigation comes as the federal government has few regulations governing autonomous vehicles and driver-assist systems that can drive a car under certain circumstances. the systems can significantly reduce crashes, but computer-driven vehicles also can make mistakes.",

        "body": "ntsb: tesla autopilot was engaged before fatal florida crash. a tesla model 3 involved in a fatal crash with a semitrailer in florida march 1 was operating on the company's semi-autonomous autopilot system, federal investigators have determined. the car drove beneath the trailer, killing the driver, in a crash that is strikingly similar to one that happened on the other side of florida in 2016 that also involved use of autopilot. (ntsb). in both cases, neither the driver nor the autopilot system stopped for the trailers, and the roofs of the cars were sheared off. the delray beach crash, which remains under investigation by the national transportation safety board and the national highway traffic safety administration, raises questions about the effectiveness of autopilot, which uses cameras, long-range radar and computers to detect objects in front of the cars to avoid collisions. the system also can keep a car in its lane, change lanes and navigate freeway interchanges. tesla has maintained that the system is designed only to assist drivers, who must pay attention at all times and be ready to intervene. in a preliminary report on the march 1 crash, the ntsb said that initial data and video from the tesla show that the driver turned on autopilot about 10 seconds before the crash on a divided highway with turn lanes in the median. from less than eight seconds until the time of the crash, the driver's hands were not detected on the steering wheel, the ntsb report stated. tesla model 3 test drive. neither the data nor the videos indicated the driver or the autopilot system braked or tried to avoid the trailer, the report stated. the model 3 was going 68 miles per hour when it hit the trailer on u.s. 441, and the speed limit was 55 mph, the report said. jeremy beren banner, 50, was killed. tesla said in a statement thursday that banner did not use autopilot at any other time during the drive before the crash. vehicle logs show that he took his hands off the steering wheel immediately after activating autopilot, the statement said. tesla also said it's saddened by the crash and that drivers have traveled more than 1 billion miles while using autopilot. \"when used properly by an attentive driver who is prepared to take control at all times, drivers supported by autopilot are safer than those operating without assistance,\" the company said. porn shot in tesla on autopilot:. the circumstances of the delray beach crash are much like one that occurred in may 2016 near gainesville, florida. joshua brown, 40, of canton, ohio, was traveling in a tesla model s on a divided highway and using the autopilot system when he was killed. neither brown nor the car braked for a tractor-trailer, which had turned left in front of the tesla and was crossing its path. brown's tesla also went beneath the trailer and its roof was sheared off. after that crash tesla ceo elon musk said the company made changes in its system so radar would play more of a role in detecting objects. david friedman, who was acting head of nhtsa in 2014 and is now vice president of advocacy for consumer reports, said he was surprised the agency didn't declare autopilot defective after the gainesville crash and seek a recall. the delray beach crash, he said, reinforces that autopilot is being allowed to operate in situations it cannot handle safely. \"their system cannot literally see the broad side of an 18-wheeler on the highway,\" friedman said. tesla's system was too slow to warn the driver to pay attention, unlike systems that consumer reports has tested from general motors and other companies, friedman said. gm's super cruise driver assist system only operates on divided highways with no median turn lanes, he said. tesla needs a better system to more quickly detect whether drivers are paying attention and warn them if they are not, friedman said, adding that some owners tend to rely on the system too much. \"tesla has for too long been using human drivers as guinea pigs. this is tragically what happens,\" he said. to force a recall, nhtsa must do an investigation and show that the way a vehicle is designed is outside of industry standards. \"there are multiple systems out on the roads right now that take over some level of steering and speed control, but there's only one of them that we keep hearing about where people are dying or getting into crashes. that kind of stands out,\" friedman said. nhtsa said thursday that its investigation is continuing and its findings will be made public when it's completed. the delray beach crash casts doubt on musk's statement that tesla will have fully self-driving vehicles on the roads sometime next year. musk said last month that tesla had developed a powerful computer that could use artificial intelligence to safely navigate the roads with the same camera and radar sensors that are now on tesla cars. \"show me the data,\" friedman said. \"tesla is long on big claims and short on proof. they're literally showing how not to do it by rushing technology out.\". in a 2017 report on the gainesville crash, the ntsb wrote that design limitations of autopilot played a major role. the agency said that tesla told model s owners that autopilot should be used only on limited-access highways, primarily interstates. the report said that despite upgrades to the system, tesla did not incorporate protections against use of the system on other types of roads. the ntsb found that the model s cameras and radar weren't capable of detecting a vehicle turning into its path. rather, the systems are designed to detect vehicles they are following to prevent rear-end collisions.",

        "body": "musk: it's 'insane' not to buy a tesla. robotaxis coming next year. tesla ceo elon musk expects to start converting the company's electric cars into fully self-driving vehicles next year as part of an audacious plan to create a network of robotic taxis to compete against uber and other ride-hailing services. the vision sketched out monday during an event at tesla's silicon valley headquarters requires several leaps of faith - something that the zealous investors and consumers who view musk as a technological genius often are willing to take. but self-driving car experts fear musk is shirking public safety in an effort to boost tesla's stock and sell more of the company's electric cars. this amid lingering questions about whether the 15-year-old automaker can consistently make money. \"it sounds like a pipe dream that he's selling people,\" said raj rajkumar, an electrical and computer engineering professor at carnegie mellon university. \"i think it's basically overpromising, which is typical of elon musk.\". to prove his skeptics wrong, musk will have to persuade regulators that tesla's technology for transforming potentially hundreds of thousands of electric cars into self-driving vehicles will produce robots that are safer and more reliable than humans. fox news autos test drive: tesla model 3. and to do that, musk will have to be correct in his bet that tesla has come up with a better way to produce self-driving cars than virtually every other of the more than 60 companies in the u.s. working toward the same goal. some of those companies are aiming to have their fully autonomous cars begin carrying passengers in small geographic areas as early as this year, but many experts don't believe they'll be in widespread use for a decade or more. unlike most of those other companies, tesla's cars won't come with the light beam sensors called lidar that many industry experts consider to be essential equipment for robotic vehicles to navigate the road. (tesla). musk trashed lidar as a \"fool's errand\" and \"frigging stupid\" in a putdown of companies such as google spin-off waymo and general motors' cruise automation that are including the light beam sensors in their systems. \"they are going to dump lidar,\" musk assured investors and analysts gathered at tesla's palo alto, california, office for the 2 1\u20442 hour presentation. musk, widely known for his swagger as much as his smarts, spent much of the time trying to persuade both the investors and consumers that he had figured out a better way to teach robots how to drive. \"it is fundamentally insane to buy anything other than a tesla,\" musk said at one point, arguing that purchasing a vehicle from any other automaker would be like getting a horse. musk's quasi-sales pitch came two days before tesla is expected to report a disappointing performance for the first three months of the year. analysts polled by factset predict a $305.5 million first quarter net loss based on disappointing car sales, a setback after musk pledged heading into the second half of last year that tesla would be profitable from that point onward. tesla's stock sank by nearly 4 percent to close monday at $262.75. from musk's vantage point, tesla has a huge advantage over autonomous vehicle competitors because it gathers a massive amount of data in the real world. this quarter, he said tesla will have 500,000 vehicles on the road, each equipped with eight cameras, ultrasonic sensors and radar gathering data to help build the company's neural network, which will serve as the digital equivalent of the self-driving cars' consciousness. the network allows vehicles to recognize images, determine what objects are and figure out how to deal with them. to become fully self-driving, the cars also need a special computer that fits behind the glove box and is powered by a special chip musk boasted is better than any other processor in the world \"by a huge margin.\". currently the self-driving computer costs $5,000, but the price rises to $7,000 if it's installed after delivery. finally, tesla will deliver software updates to those computers to make it possible for its electric cars to be driven by a robot, without a human in position to take over in case something goes awry. there will be a slight chance of some \"fender benders,\" musk acknowledged monday, and indicated tesla will be liable for accident caused by a vehicle under the control of its robot. \"people will die,\" rajkumar predicted. \"i can tell you that right now. because in the real world, crazy things happen.\". musk predicted that the technology for fully self-driving tesla will roll out at some point from april to june next year. then, tesla will need to get regulatory approval for the fully autonomous cars to drive on roads, something musk predicted would happen in a few states by the end of next year. he didn't specific where tesla will try to gain approval first. california, tesla's biggest u.s. market, requires proof that fully autonomous cars can drive safely on public roads, but most other states aren't as stringent. and experts say there's no federal law requiring preapproval for fully autonomous driving, as long as a vehicle meets federal safety standards, which teslas already do. within three years, tesla will be manufacturing self-driving cars that don't even have steering wheels or brake pedals in them, musk said. if they're allowed on the roads, fully driverless cars would allow musk to carry out his plan to expand into the ride-hailing market with a fleet of sleek teslas. owners of teslas with the company's self-driving computer could plug into an app-based network to pick up fare-paying passengers when they didn't need to use their vehicle. musk theorizes that a ride-hailing service similar to uber and lyft will boost tesla's revenue and make it easier for the company to sell its cars to consumers who could effectively lower the cost of ownership by making money on the side. tesla would get 20% to 25% of each fare in the network. tesla also intends to convert all the electric cars under leasing contracts to be turned into robotaxis upon their return. uber and lyft also consider driverless cars to be one of the keys to making money from their still unprofitable services, but haven't set a specific timetable for achieving that breakthrough while they continue to work on their own autonomous technology. waymo rolled out a ride-hailing service using self-driving vehicles late last year in the phoenix area, but it only available to a small pool of passengers who were previously enrolled in a test program. and all the cars in waymo's ride-hailing service still have a human behind the steering wheel ready to take control. the waymo cars also have lidar, something experts remain convinced must be part of any fully self-driving car, despite musk's colorful contentions otherwise. \"vehicles that don't have lidar, that don't have advanced radar, that haven't captured a 3-d map are not self-driving vehicles,\" ken washington, ford's chief technical officer, said during a recent interview with recode. \"they are great consumer vehicles with really good driver-assist technology.\".",

        "body": "tesla model 3 test drive: a masterwork ... in progress. of all the cars on sale today, the only one that would qualify as an influencer if it were human would be the tesla model 3. love it. loathe it. it doesn't matter how you feel. there's no other car that's changing the conversation the way that the sleek sedan is. the chevy bolt and nissan leaf? not trending. i recently got around to spending some quality time in a model 3 that i borrowed from a private owner. it wasn't the long-awaited $35,000 model (which folks are still waiting for), but a dual-motor long range with a premium interior and about 6,000 miles on it. all problem-free, according to him. (fox news autos). he said he paid $53,000 for it last year. last week a similar car cost $48,500. today it's $49,500. this is how tesla's direct sales model works. it meets demand with frequent list price adjustments, sometimes dramatic, instead of offering incentives. it differs from industry practice, and is an honest way of doing things, but for loyal customers tracking the resale value of their cars, or wall street investors watching the company, comes across as a bit frenetic. one thing that won't change is the size of the model 3, which is more of a compact 4-door than the midsize elon musk and tesla bill it as. it's not as long and has the same rear legroom as a bmw 3-series, a chief competitor and the quintessential compact. what makes the difference is that the overall interior volume - boosted by a front trunk where an internal combustion engine would usually be - squeezes it over the threshold for a midsize on the epa scale. the driver's seat isn't all the way back in this photo, but set comfortably for the author's 6-foot 1-inch frame.\n      (fox news autos). in reality, if 6-footers are in the front seats, either they are completely comfortable, or no one is. there's nothing wrong with this. some cars are just smaller than others, but if you're buying a model 3 sight unseen, as many do, don't expect a limousine to get dropped off in front of your house on delivery day. (tesla). the cabin is airy, however, thanks to a full panoramic glass roof that's tinted just enough to dim the sunlight to a pleasant level. at least in new york in early spring. even rear seat passengers have the sky above their heads. below them is a synthetic leather that's so supple it feels more like a fabric than a hide. if i could, i would upholster my entire life with it. the front seats are showstoppers that fully live up to the \"premium\" billing and do a lot to distract from the fact that the rest of the cabin trim isn't any nicer that what you find in a mazda these days. (tesla). the minimalist design of the dashboard is visually stunning, however, as it stretches door to door with just a steering wheel to ruin the symmetry. in models with a wood trim, it reminds me of an atari 2600 console. this is an interesting coincidence since the 15-inch touchscreen mounted in the center of it is equipped with several games from the company's archive. the screen is also what you use to control nearly everything in the model 3 and it houses all of its displays, including the speedometer. the positioning is fine, but considering how much real estate is available, some of the text and icons are smaller than necessary. executing simple tasks, like adjusting the steering wheel or climate control, also require more steps than knobs or buttons would and your eyes off the road for too long. the fact that it does so many things is impressive, the ease and speed at which it does some of them less so. (tesla). that's where autopilot comes in. tesla's semi-autonomous driving aid is a countermeasure to distractions, although it can be a bit of one itself. it has an evolving feature set that makes it hard to resist pushing the limits to see what it is capable of when you should be relying on it as backup to your own driving. autopilot can control the speed of the car and steer it within a lane, which it excels at on the highway. as long as it has a bead on things, it's smoother than you would likely be. the slower and windier the road gets, the jerkier its inputs become, but i can see why videos have started popping up of \"sleeping\" tesla drivers, because it lulls you into a sense of confidence in its abilities. if you take your hand off the wheel, it will eventually warn you not to do that and then disengage. tesla hasn't made it clear exactly how long the model 3 can go without any driver input, but i went about a minute before it posted a message on the screen, followed by a flashing light and then an audible alarm as it signed off. if you make it that far, you have to pull over and turn the car off to use autopilot again. if you don't do anything, it's programmed to turn the hazard lights on and bring itself to a stop in the lane. but keep checking in and autopilot will cruise indefinitely. there are mercedes-benzes that can do this, but the tesla does it better. both systems will also change lanes with a flick of the turn signal, but here the mercedes-benz might have the tesla beat. in a couple of instances, when there was a car far behind me in the passing lane, the model 3 couldn't seem to figure out if it should go or not and started doing an unnerving serpentine before making the move. in my experience, mercedes-benz's system is more decisive. soon, you won't have to be in the tesla. it offers a navigate on autopilot feature that can drive the car all the way from on ramp to off ramp on the highway if you have a destination set, merging into traffic, changing lanes and passing other vehicles along the way. initially, it would only suggest the maneuvers and require you to acknowledge them with the turn signal stalk, but there's an update rolling out that that's smarter and allows you to give it blanket prior approval to just go for it whenever it wants to, as long as it senses any sort of \"user\" input, according to musk. the version i tried was a mixed bag. it was seamless most of the time, but often abruptly adjusted its speed in the merging lanes, and once accelerated rapidly directly toward two cars that were far too close for it to fit between them. i didn't wait to see how that was going to pan out and tapped the brakes. negotiating off ramps was both inconsistent and consistent. i used the same exit five times as a control. twice the car asked me to take over before we even arrived at it and on the three other attempts it followed an aggressive line at a speed faster than i would have, but exactly the same one each try. tesla constantly collects data from all of its cars on the road to update how autopilot works, and i got the impression it had developed that specific path from the information, rather than just having the car follow the painted lines. (tesla). autopilot is a work in progress and far from perfect, and my experience suggests that you should resist the urge to convince yourself that it is. people have gotten hurt and worse by doing that. but if you treat it as an assistant, it may save your bacon someday. according to tesla, its data indicates that you're much less likely get into an accident with it turned on. the model 3 is a car you'll want to drive yourself, anyway. and with 310 miles of range that can be replenished to 80 percent in about 40 minutes at the newest supercharger stations, you can do plenty of that. the rear-wheel-drive model was also rated at only 310 when it was new, but an over-the-air software update in the middle of the night a few weeks ago added an extra 15 while also making all model 3s a little faster. the tooth fairy is on notice.tesla's a bit hazy on how much power the model 3 has on tap, but says it will accelerate to 60 mph in under 4.5 seconds. that speed arrives in near silence with all of the immediacy that electric motors are known for. (tesla). the steering is similarly responsive and the model 3 feels solid as a steel brick, despite concerns raised by consumer reports and others about its long-term reliability. its tires are a little stiff for the new york metro area's rutted roads, but the overall blend of ride and handling is superb for car that doesn't have an electronically controlled suspension. turn up the juice in a bend and you'll find that it's tail-happier than a typical all-wheel-drive car, but that's the fun way around one. if not the most reassuring for everyone onboard. the problem with making a final assessment about the model 3 is that it's a constantly moving target. even in the time since i started writing this, tesla altered its model lineup and added a leasing program. one thing is for certain: there's no electric car anywhere near its price range that comes close to competing with it, and a lot of the liquid-fueled ones have trouble, too. follow fox news autos on facebook for more. this story has been updated to clarify the specifications.",

        "body": "tesla takes $35,000 model 3 sales offline, but adds 3-year lease plan for its smallest car. tesla will no longer sell its entry-level $35,000 standard range model 3 online, and will instead require interested customers to call or visit a store to order one. the sedans will also be delivered with the higher capacity battery pack of the standard range plus model, but with a software restriction that limits their range from 240 to 220 miles. original and subsequent owners will be able to pay to have the additional range unlocked at any time. (tesla). tesla said the move was largely due to the fact that the plus has been outselling the standard range by a factor of 6 to 1. limiting the number of battery pack sizes it offers helps streamlines production, and the company has used a similar strategy several times previously to update the model s and x lineups. tesla model y debuts with $39,000 base price. the model y utility vehicle shares a platform with the model 3.\n      (tesla). the base price of the plus has also been increased from $37,500 to $39,500, but it now comes with the semi-autonomous autopilot electronic driving aid, which was a $3,000 option. tesla's release on the changes said that \"all tesla vehicles now come with autopilot bundled as a standard feature,\" but fox news autos has confirmed that the feature is not active on the $35,000 version of the model 3. the rear-wheel-drive long range model 3 has also been removed from the website and joins the standard range model 3 as an off-menu model that must be ordered in-store or on the phone. along with the lineup changes, tesla announced its first leasing program for the model 3, which requires a $3,000 down payment, but does not allow leases to buy their car at the end of the 36-month term. that's because tesla is planning to use them for an autonomous ride-hailing service it expects to have up and running by then, which will also allow owners to hire out their vehicles when they are not using them. elon musk explains reason for tesla model 3's mysterious cockpit camera.",

(tesla). ceo elon musk has previously detailed the long-term goal for such a system, which would theoretically allow owners of fully self-driving teslas to hire them out as taxis when they're not using them for themselves. responding to a twitter question about it from one of his followers, musk revealed that the camera above the rearview mirror is primarily there to keep an eye on passengers using the service and provide evidence if anyone \"messes up\" a car. he added that the cameras can also see out of the windows to provide additional input for other features. eight additional cameras are located around the exterior of the model 3.\n      (tesla). while some have speculated that it could also be used as a monitor to help assure that a driver is watching the road while using the semi-autonomous autopilot system, musk did not suggest that possibility, instead pointing out that owners will have the option of turning it off completely. a recent cnbc report detailed how much unencrypted personal data, including video, is stored onboard a tesla and able to be extracted after an accident if not intentionally wiped clean by the owner. the interior camera is not present on the current versions of the model s or model x. musk said that more information about the ride-hailing scheme and the technology behind it will be released during a webcast on april 22. what are those holes in my dashboard for, anyway?.

        "body": "court gives elon musk, sec two weeks to settle tweet dispute. (ap). a judge on thursday urged stock market regulators and tesla ceo elon musk to amicably settle their dispute over his tweets. if not, she said she'll decide whether to grant regulators' request that the outspoken executive face escalating fines if he breaks rules protecting investors. u.s. district judge alison j. nathan asked how she should punish musk if she finds him in contempt for violating a deal with the securities and exchange commission requiring him to first clear with lawyers tweets that might disclose important company facts. sec attorney cheryl crumpton recommended fines. but at the end of the hearing, nathan ordered both sides to seek a resolution over the next two weeks. \"everybody take a deep breath, put your reasonableness pants on and work this out,\" nathan said. even so, nathan said court-supervised agreements must be obeyed. \"i don't care if you are a small potato or a big fish,\" nathan said as musk, with an estimated worth of $22 billion, sat at a defense table with his lawyers. nathan pressed crumpton during the hearing to define the conditions under which musk should seek approval before he tweets, and drew attention to ambiguity surrounding the rules the sec sought to enforce. musk, who followed the back-and-forth intently with a slight frown and furrowed brow, emerged from the courtroom to say: \"i'm very happy with the result and i'm impressed with judge nathan's analysis.\". legal experts said it makes sense for the two sides to negotiate another settlement rather than to leave the decision to nathan, although they cautioned it's always difficult to predict what the famously mercurial musk will do. \"the big question is whether he will dig in his heels and resist,\" said peter henning, a wayne state university law professor and former sec attorney. \"i get the feeling they will come up with something because musk probably doesn't want to risk being held in contempt of court. that will be like two strikes against him.\". attorney john hueston, representing musk, told the judge the sec had failed to show his client had violated the deal. he said his client was \"somebody trying his best to comply.\". \"he actually does what he is told,\" hueston said. in a statement after the hearing, musk signaled he is willing to work out a deal with regulators. \"we have always felt that we should be able to work through any disagreements directly with the sec, rather than prematurely rushing to court,\" he said. the issue over musk's tweets stems from a settlement reached last year after musk tweeted that he had secured the funding to take tesla private at $420 a share - a substantial premium over the price at the time - when he did not. that tweet, last august, sent the company's stock on a wild ride. the sec says it hurt investors who bought tesla stock after the tweet but before they had accurate information. musk later backed off the idea of taking the company private, but regulators concluded he had not lined up the money to pull off the deal. the sec says musk blatantly violated the settlement in february when he tweeted about tesla's vehicle production without a lawyer's approval. musk's 13-word tweet on feb. 19 said tesla would produce around 500,000 vehicles this year. but the tweet wasn't approved by tesla's \"disclosure counsel,\" and the sec's contempt-of-court motion filed that month said musk had not sought a lawyer's approval for a single tweet. musk said his tweet about car production didn't need pre-approval because it wasn't new information that would be meaningful to investors. his attorneys said the sec was violating his first amendment rights to free speech. much of the debate thursday centered around whether the sec rules provide a clear way to for musk to determine whether or not the information he's about to tweet would be material to investors and, therefore, require preapproval from lawyers. \"this case is like a shot across the bow from the sec,\" said marc leaf, a new york lawyer who formerly worked for the agency and advised on its settlement agreements. \"what they would like tesla's board to do is tell elon, 'you are a genius but your tweets aren't the smartest thing to be doing, so cut it out.'\". but hueston argued further restricting musk's ability to communicate about his company and imposing fines would \"freeze his ability\" to operate as an effective entrepreneur. to support his arguments, hueston cited an earlier exchange between the judge and crumpton in which nathan said she was \"surprised\" that the sec left it up to musk in so many instances whether to run by his lawyers what he intended to put out publicly. \"does he need preapproval?\" the judge asked crumpton at one point. \"we're not saying 'yes' or 'no,'\" she responded. hueston said the sec's first step after the tweet about production should have been to approach tesla in good faith, and nathan agreed. \"the parties should be meeting, conferring and providing some clarity so this issue won't happen again,\" hueston said. the sec says its deal doesn't restrict musk's freedom of speech because as long as his statements are not false or misleading, they would be approved. meanwhile, tesla's shares fell 8% thursday after the company disclosed that both its car manufacturing pace and vehicle delivery rate slowed during the first three months of the year, raising questions about its ability to be consistently profitable. the sec sought to oust musk from his role as chairman and ceo over his august tweet. instead, musk and tesla agreed to pay $40 million and made other concessions to settle the case and ensure musk remained ceo. musk's unpredictable behavior has led some to question whether he should remain in that job, while others say he's a visionary too valuable to lose. last year, musk berated stock market analysts for asking questions about tesla's finances and prompted a defamation lawsuit when he called a diver who helped rescue 12 boys on a thai soccer team from a flooded cave a pedophile.",

        "body": "tesla deliveries down 31% in first quarter. (ap). tesla's assembly lines slowed and deliveries fell during a rocky start to the new year that is likely to magnify nagging doubts about the company's ability to post sustained profits. the palo alto, california, company churned out 77,100 vehicles from january to march, well behind the pace it must sustain to fulfill ceo elon musk's pledge to manufacture 500,000 cars annually. the company only delivered 63,000 vehicles in the quarter, down 31% from 2018's fourth quarter. it cited a big increase in vehicle deliveries to europe and china and \"many challenges encountered for the first time.\". the lower-than-expected delivery numbers and \"pricing adjustments\" will take a bite out of tesla's first-quarter net income, it said. but it said it ended the quarter with sufficient cash on hand. tesla said it still expects to deliver between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles this year. the first-quarter production figures announced late wednesday lagged the 86,555 vehicles that tesla manufactured during the final three months of last year when the company was scrambling to make more cars. that push helped tesla post a profit in back-to-back quarters for the first time in its 15-year history. musk has already warned investors that the company will lose money during this year's first quarter amid cost-cutting needed to lower the price of its model 3, its first electric car designed for the mass market. the company produced 62,950 model 3s in this year's first quarter, up 1.6% from 61,934 in the prior three months. musk has acknowledged that tesla's hopes of becoming a consistent moneymaker are riding on the success of the model 3 and a sport utility vehicle called the model y scheduled to be released next year. and for those vehicles to become hits, tesla will have to be able to produce them in high volumes. the company didn't provide further details on how it fared financially during the first quarter. its quarterly results are expected to be released late this month or in early may. tesla attributed the production decline to the cancellation of lower-priced versions of the models s and x, a move the company said was designed to differentiate the more expensive vehicles from the model 3. the lower production figures come amid more uncertainty for a company that seems to be caught in an endless cycle of turmoil. u.s. stock market regulators are accusing musk of improperly tweeting about tesla's manufacturing volume in february when he predicted that the company would make about 500,000 cars this year. a few hours later, he backtracked slightly, saying he meant tesla would be manufacturing about 125,000 cars per quarter by the end of this year, a pace that would translate into 500,000 vehicles annually. either way, the securities and exchange commission alleges musk's tweet violated a court-approved settlement that called for him to have his tweets about tesla information pre-approved by the company. that requirement is part of a $40 million settlement reached last year after musk tweeted he lined up the financing needed to lead a buyout of a tesla, a claim that the sec asserted was a misleading statement that duped investors. musk has vehemently denied his february tweet violated the settlement and is fighting the sec's attempt to have him held in contempt of court. u.s. district judge alison nathan is scheduled to hear further arguments about the case during a hearing scheduled thursday in new york.",

(getty images/frederic j. brown (top)/tesla (bottom)). tesla is still a couple of years away from selling a pickup, but elon musk is already talking smack about other trucks. musk was tweeting about how tesla's autopilot feature reduces driver fatigue, when dodge ram owner wrote: \"you would still be physically fatigued if you tried to haul 12,000 lbs of steel beams like i do every day with my dodge ram, 2019s motor trend [sp] truck of the year.\". musk responded \"12,000 lbs!? how puny. do you construct children's toys?\". musk has previously claimed tesla's electric truck will have \"crazy torque\" and be able to tow 300,000 pounds. the 2019 ram heavy duty pickup is a monstrous truck:. while it's unlikely that will be its official sae-approved rating, which is calculated through a series of acceleration, braking and uphill towing tests, conventional pickups have performed amazing feats of strength over short distances. the most memorable of these exhibitions involved a toyota tundra with a 10,100-pound tow rating pulling the 292,000-pound space shuttle endeavour a quarter-mile down a los angeles street, while even a battery-powered tesla model x suv, which is rated at 5,000 pounds, once towed a 287,000-pound boeing 787 down an airport taxiway. it's unknown if musk was aware that dodge ram owner is a self-proclaimed parody account that often posts tweets with references to porn, suggestions that ford truck owners engage in incest and continually calls the toyota tacoma a \"terrorist truck.\" ram was spun off from dodge as an independent brand in 2010. following musk's tweet, the account, which has 26.5k followers, gleefully proclaimed \"lmfao!!! just roped in elon musk. this ain't over yet elon. not by a long shot!\". musk has said that tesla should be ready to unveil its futuristic 'cyberpunk' pickup sometime this year, but has not confirmed when it will go into production. the next additions to its lineup, the model y suv and a semi-tractor, are scheduled to begin deliveries next year. more from fox news autos.",

after major setbacks in other cities. las vegas' tourism agency announced wednesday it is recommending that an enterprise backed by the divisive billionaire receive a contract to build and operate an underground tunnel system through which autonomous electric vehicles would whisk people around a mega convention center, and in the future, possibly the city's famous casino-filled corridor. autonomous shuttles have been proposed for the system.\n      (ap). if approved, the system of just over a mile long would debut by january 2021 at the facility, which hosts more than 1 million people every year. the musk-owned the boring company would build the project costing from $35 million to $55 million. the boring company unveils high-speed underground transportation system. it's different from his beleaguered efforts to build underground tunnel systems in other cities because musk will be paid for it if the contract is approved. projects in los angeles and chicago have drawn opposition and skepticism from residents and officials about whether they will actually open. musk has faced recent blowback because of his behavior and tweeting habits. he has had dust-ups with stock market regulators and agreed last year to step down as chairman of the board of tesla, his electric car company. but las vegas tourism officials are ready to get on board with a musk project. \"it's really innovative. i think it will be an attraction in and of itself, frankly,\" steve hill, president and ceo of the las vegas convention and visitors authority, told the associated press. the loop will be incorporated into an expanded convention center complex.\n      (ap). details of the project have not been finalized. but hill said the system will probably have three or four stations, each situated at entrances to the convention center's halls. people would be carried to the hall of their choice in electric vehicles moving through parallel tunnels, each running in one direction. the fleet could include tesla's model x and model 3 and a vehicle with capacity for about 16 people, hill said. all vehicles would be fully autonomous, meaning they won't have backup human drivers. the las vegas convention center, which attracts worldwide gatherings including the premier consumer electronics show, is undergoing an expansion. when finished, convention attendees could log about two miles walking from one end to the other. the distance led officials to look for a transportation solution. the service within the convention center is expected to be free for people attending events. the convention center is operated by the authority, which is funded by a county room tax and is responsible for promoting the destination around the world. the tourism agency is governed by a board of directors. the authority is expected to present to the board the recommendation to select musk's company march 12. if approved, hill said the agency hopes to return to the board with a full design and proposed contract by june. musk in december unveiled a test tunnel built under a los angeles suburb, allowing reporters and guests to take rides. it came almost two years to the day after musk announced on twitter that \"traffic is driving me nuts\" and he was \"going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging.\". \"i am actually going to do this,\" he added in response to initial skepticism. soon after, he began the boring company, tongue in cheek intentional. the skepticism has not subsided. the boring company in november canceled its plans for another test tunnel in the los angeles area after a neighborhood group filed a lawsuit over concerns about traffic and disruptions from trucks hauling out dirt during the boring process. now plans for a project in chicago appear to be in jeopardy. neither mayoral candidate approves of plans announced in june that called for a system similar to the one proposed for las vegas. it would carry people between chicago's downtown and o'hare international airport at speeds of up to 150 mph through underground tunnels. feds investigating fatal tesla model 3 crash in florida. hill said he does not expect permitting processes in the las vegas area to put the project behind schedule should it be approved, because the city is \"committed to innovation.\". \"look at everything that we have built in las vegas, and this city and everybody who has built it found ways to make that happen,\" he said. \"as long as this continues to make sense, i believe that we will figure out how to make it happen.\". hill acknowledged the technology that will be used in the project has not been used commercially, but he said the company has the talent to make the project a reality. the confidence in the boring company is such that the authority already has optional routes for the tunnel system to expand to connect to the las vegas strip, the city's downtown and mccarran international airport. an expansion of that magnitude could be a solution to the congestion affecting the strip and nearby areas. \"we do see it as a real opportunity and something we would like to pursue,\" hill said. steve davis, president of the boring company, said the speed at which the vehicles will move inside the convention center's tunnels will depend on the number of stations built. the technology involved in the project is being tested every day in the tunnel in hawthorne, california, he said. the company believes it will be able to deliver the project by the 2021 deadline, just before that year's edition of the ces tech gadget gathering. it is also eyeing the expansion possibility. \"if the community likes it, and they come, they ride at the convention center and they say 'this is great. it's comfortable. it's fast. it's awesome.' well, there are other places it can go,\" davis said.",

(tesla). in its third quarter investor update letter, tesla called this \"an extremely important metric as it allows an ev to reach a long epa range even when using a relatively small, inexpensive battery pack,\" and mentioned how its all-wheel-drive cars are significantly more efficient than their current and upcoming competition. at the moment, that is restricted to the recently released jaguar i-pace, which has an epa combined rating of just 76 mpge and gets 234 miles out of its 90 kwh battery. for comparison, the no-longer-produced, much larger and heavier model x with the same size battery was rated at 92 mpge and had a 257-mile range, while the current 75 kwh version is listed at 93 mpge with a 238-mile range. tesla clearly holds a significant advantage in power management, and should continue to do so through next year when the audi e-tron suv, which is similar in size to the i-pace, joins the fray with a 95 kwh pack and a range that's likely to be less than 250 miles. musk elaborated on the subject during the earnings report conference call, bringing it up after none of the analysts or journalists asked about it. musk told them that not only are tesla's powertrains the most efficient, but its batteries are also cheaper to produce. he then chided the legacy automakers for not investing more in their technology or collaborating with tesla when the opportunity was offered. not content with winning on these points, the tesla report added that the performance version of the model 3 is the quickest and fastest all-wheel-drive electric car on sale today. its 0-60 mph time of 3.3 seconds and 155 mph top speed are both significantly better than the i-pace's 4.5-second and 124 mph marks, although there are plenty of apples and oranges here because the model 3 is a sedan and the i-pace is an suv. nevertheless, tesla has set a new target for others to aim at, and it hit it right in the bullseye, of course.",

(tesla). electric auto brand tesla inc. said it signed an agreement wednesday to secure land in shanghai for its first factory outside the united states, pushing ahead with development despite mounting u.s.-chinese trade tensions. tesla, based in palo alto, california, announced plans for the shanghai factory in july after the chinese government said it would end restrictions on full foreign ownership of electric vehicle makers to speed up industry development. those plans have gone ahead despite tariff hikes by washington and beijing on billions of dollars of each other's goods in a dispute over chinese technology policy. u.s. imports targeted by beijing's penalties include electric cars. china is the biggest global electric vehicle market and tesla's second-largest after the united states. tesla joins global automakers including general motors co., volkswagen ag and nissan motor corp. that are pouring billions of dollars into manufacturing electric vehicles in china. local production would eliminate risks from tariffs and other import controls. it would help tesla develop parts suppliers to support after service and make its vehicles more appealing to mainstream chinese buyers. tesla said it signed a \"land transfer agreement\" on a 210-acre site in the lingang district in southeastern shanghai. that is \"an important milestone for what will be our next advanced, sustainably developed manufacturing site,\" tesla's vice president of worldwide sales, robin ren, said in a statement. shanghai is a center of china's auto industry and home to state-owned shanghai automotive industries corp., the main local manufacturer for gm and vw. tesla said earlier that production in shanghai would begin two to three years after construction of the factory begins and eventually increase to 500,000 vehicles annually. tesla has yet to say how it will pay for the shanghai factory. the company has yet to give a price tag but the shanghai government said it would be the biggest foreign investment there to date. tesla's $5 billion nevada battery factory was financed with help from a $1.6 billion investment by battery maker panasonic corp. analysts expect tesla to report a loss of about $200 million for the three months ending sept. 30 following the previous quarter's $742.7 million loss. its ceo elon musk said in a sept. 30 letter to u.s. securities regulators that the company is \"very close to achieving profitability.\". tesla's estimated sales in china of under 15,000 vehicles in 2017 gave it a market share of less than 3 percent. the company faces competition from chinese brands including byd auto and baic group that already sell tens of thousands of hybrid and pure-electric sedans and suvs annually. until now, foreign automakers that wanted to manufacture in china were required to work through state-owned partners. foreign brands balked at bringing electric vehicle technology into china to avoid having to share it with potential future competitors. the first of the new electric models being developed by global automakers to hit the market, nissan's sylphy zero emission, began rolling off a production line in southern china in august. lower-priced electric models from gm, volkswagen and other global brands are due to hit the market starting this year, well before tesla is up and running in shanghai.",

(getty). tax day is april 15, but for potential tesla buyers looking to maximize their electric car tax break, oct. 15 is the day they need to worry about. that's because cars ordered from the automaker through that date will be eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit, which starts phasing out at the end of the year. according to reuters, tesla has said that anyone who places an order by monday will have their car delivered before the stroke of midnight on new year's day. showroom inventory purchased up to that date should also eligible for the credit, but tesla did not respond to a request for clarification. after that, since tesla has crossed the program's 200,000-car threshold, the credit drops to $3,750 for six months, then $1,875 before it's gone altogether at the end of 2019. the rule applies to every automaker that sells cars in the united states, and plug-in hybrids are counted the same as full electrics, even though their battery pack size-based incentives are often lower. chevrolet and nissan are the only two other automakers close to hitting the 200,000 mark, while jaguar, audi and other brands just ramping up their electric car efforts have a long way to go. the idea behind the program was to help automakers develop expensive new technologies, with the hopes that the cost to manufacture them would decrease with volume, allowing companies to build the vehicles more profitably and at a lower cost to consumers. tesla has not yet said if it plans to adjust the prices of its vehicles to compensate for the reduced credit. the cheapest car it currently offers is a rear-wheel-drive model 3 that starts at $49,000, while the promised entry-level $35,000 version isn't expected to go on sale before next year. the federal program is independent of any incentives offered at the state level. 2019 jaguar i-pace -- tesla has company:.",

        "body": "elon musk says saudi arabia's sovereign wealth fund may help take tesla private. saudi arabia's sovereign wealth fund would be the main source of money for tesla ceo elon musk's grand plan to take the company private, but the deal isn't done yet, musk disclosed in a blog on monday. the fund approached musk about going private multiple times during the past two years, and musk says he left a july 31 meeting with no question that the deal could be closed. that's why he tweeted on aug. 7 that he had \"funding secured\" to take the company private. it is that phrase that may lead to trouble for musk. if the tweet is deemed by regulators to be a factual statement, and it was taken as such by investors who drove shares up 11 percent on that day, musk could be at risk for securities fraud if it wasn't entirely true. already there are reports that the u.s. securities and exchange commission is looking into musk's tweet. funding for the deal would come from the ultraconservative kingdom's public investment fund, one of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds. founded in 1971, the fund has some $250 billion in investments across the world, according to the sovereign wealth fund institute, based in las vegas. among its holdings include a $3.5 billion stake in the ride-sharing app uber. a fund spokesman declined to comment monday night in riyadh. musk's blog , posted before the markets opened monday, didn't impress investors much. shares fell $3.10 to $352.39 in midday trading. under his proposal, only investors who don't want to remain with a private company would be paid, and funding for the deal would come from tesla stock, not debt. musk wrote that he expects about one-third of shareholders to take an offer of $420 per share, making the buyouts worth roughly $23.6 billion. presumably the wealth fund and perhaps other investors would put up the money to buy the shares and would be repaid in tesla equity. musk wrote that at the july 31 meeting, the fund's managing director \"strongly expressed his support\" for taking the electric car and solar panel maker private. \"i understood from him that no other decision makers were needed and that they were eager to proceed,\" musk wrote in the blog. but the deal appeared to be far from finished. since the meeting, the men have continued discussions and the managing director has expressed support \"subject to financial and other due diligence and their internal review process for obtaining approvals,\" musk wrote. the wealth fund recently bought nearly 5 percent of tesla's shares. the fund's chairman is saudi arabia's assertive 32-year-old crown prince mohammed bin salman. he has used the fund as a vehicle to achieve economic goals of increasing employment in the kingdom, as well as for floating a possible public offering of the state oil giant saudi aramco, though that effort appears to have stalled. tesla has a growing following on the arabian peninsula, with a glittering new showroom in the skyscraper-studded city of dubai in the united arab emirates. musk has visited the region as well and given talks. musk wrote in monday's blog that he made the aug. 7 announcement because he had talked to large investors about his desire to take the company private. \"it wouldn't be right to share information about going private with just our largest investors without sharing the same information with all investors at the same time,\" he wrote. he wrote that he was speaking for himself as a potential bidder for the company. musk also wrote that the saudis are interested in the company because they want to diversify away from oil. musk continues to speak with other investors because he wants tesla to continue to have a \"broad investor base,\" he wrote. tesla wouldn't comment on a possible sec investigation or why it took a week for details to be released in the blog. the sec also would not comment monday. late on friday, musk used twitter to taunt investors who have bet against his company, despite the possible sec investigation. the tweets were aimed at \"shorts,\" or investors who borrow shares of tesla and immediately sell them with the hope that tesla's share price will fall. that allows the shorts to buy back the stock at a lower price, return the shares to the lender, and pocket the difference. on friday, two lawsuits were filed accusing musk of seeking to harm short sellers by artificially running up the price of the company's shares. by taking tesla private, musk believes that the company will be able to sharpen its long-term focus of revolutionizing an automobile industry dominated by fuel-combustion vehicles without having to cater to investors' fixation on how the business is faring each quarter. ____. jon gambrell in dubai and marcy gordon in washington, d.c., contributed to this report.",

        "body": "ntsb removes tesla from crash investigation, but company says it quit. federal investigators say they have booted electric car maker tesla inc. from a group that's investigating a fatal crash in california that involved an suv using the company's autopilot system. the national transportation safety board said it removed tesla as a party to the investigation after the company prematurely made information public. \"tesla violated the party agreement by releasing investigative information before it was vetted and confirmed by the ntsb,\" the agency said in a statement. \"such releases of incomplete information often lead to speculation and incorrect assumptions about the probable cause of a crash.\". tesla, however, disputed the claim and said it withdrew from the agreement two days earlier, after being told that it would be removed if it made additional statements before the ntsb finished its probe in the next 12 to 24 months. the company said it released information to correct \"misleading\" claims being made about autopilot creating safety problems. in a statement about the escalating dispute, tesla said it would file a complaint with congress and accused the ntsb of being more concerned with \"press headlines\" than promoting safety. removing a party to an investigation is rare but has happened in the past, according to the agency. companies and other organizations can become parties in a probe because they can give technical help and share sensitive information. the move means that the ntsb will no longer share information about the march 23 crash of a tesla model x suv on u.s. 101 near mountain view in silicon valley. the driver, walter huang, 38, a software engineer for apple, was killed in the crash. in a statement on march 30, tesla confirmed that the semi-autonomous autopilot system was operating at the time of the crash and seemed to blame the crash on huang. the company said huang didn't have his hands on the steering wheel for six seconds before the impact and also received several warnings from the vehicle. shortly after tesla released the information, an ntsb spokesman said the agency was \"unhappy\" about the disclosure. tesla tells drivers that its autopilot system - which uses cameras, radar and computers to keep speed, change lanes and automatically stop vehicles - requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel in order to take control to avoid accidents. the palo alto, california, company said its vehicle logs showed huang took no action to stop the model x from crashing into a concrete lane divider. the company said the crash was worsened by a missing or damaged safety shield on the end of the lane divider. the ntsb, along with the national highway traffic safety administration, is looking into the crash, as well as another tesla crash in january near los angeles in which a model s sedan smashed into a firetruck parked on a freeway. tesla would not say whether the model s in that crash was operating on autopilot. david friedman, a former nhtsa acting administrator who now is director of cars and product policy for consumers union, the advocacy arm of consumer reports, said the tesla-ntsb spat could delay the investigation if the agency doesn't have all the electronic information it needs from the company. the agency has legal options if tesla isn't forthcoming, he said, but those take time and taxpayer dollars. the ntsb, he said, has never been focused on publicity, and it has the authority to investigate new technology like autopilot. \"if anything, the ntsb is shining a spotlight on tesla because of their innovation,\" friedman said. consumers union has called for tesla to stop testing the cars with its buyers, and friedman said the company shouldn't use the name autopilot because it implies that the cars can drive themselves. \"you should name it so that it is clear what it can and can't do,\" he said. in the crash that killed huang, a tesla spokeswoman would not directly answer questions about why the suv didn't spot the freeway barrier and stop before the collision. the spokeswoman referred to a statement saying that tesla owners' manuals have warnings and notifications stating that a driver should not depend on the car's autosteer system to pick the right driving path. it also says automatic emergency braking \"is not designed to avoid a collision and is not a substitute for maintaining a safe traveling distance\" from other vehicles. in its statement thursday, tesla accused the ntsb of focusing on the \"safest cars in america\" while ignoring less-safe vehicles. tesla says there is one auto death in the u.s. for every 86 million miles driven, but for tesla vehicles, it's one death for every 320 million miles. the ntsb makes recommendations to prevent crashes, while nhtsa has authority to fine automakers, push for recalls and seek regulations.",

        "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/auto/will-your-smartphone-replace-your-car-key",
        "body": "will your smartphone replace your car key?. the new tesla model 3 has lots of eye-opening features that distinguish this fully-electric car from other hybrid and electric vehicles, including a single touch screen that replaces the traditional dashboard full of buttons and displays. still, perhaps the first big difference many model 3 drivers will notice is this tesla's lack of a traditional key fob. that familiar feature-along with the door locks and start button-has essentially been replaced by the tesla smartphone app (shown at top). the model 3 can sense an authorized driver's smartphone from up to 30 feet away, turning a driver's smartphone into a virtual key, allowing him or her to set the model 3 doors (and even the trunk) to automatically unlock when approaching the car; the doors lock themselves when the driver walks away from the car. starting the model 3 is as simple as shifting out of park. but it could be a few years before other automakers widely adopt the virtual key, as car companies and smartphone manufacturers struggle to overcome some basic issues with the technology, according to industry suppliers and researchers cr spoke to. meanwhile, automakers and phone manufacturers are still working to collaborate on standards so that a software update or security breach on your smartphone doesn't render your virtual car key useless and your car undrivable. there's also the basic question of how well today's smartphone-as-car-key technology works. for instance, cr's testers found that the model 3's virtual key isn't always as convenient or as secure as a traditional key fob. (read about cr's test of the tesla model 3's virtual key.). despite the potential benefits of virtual keys-no key fob to carry or lose (and replace for a steep price), and the fact that you can lend someone your car just by granting access through an app-some experts think it's too soon to implement the technology widely. \"i think you want to be very careful before you roll out something radically different, [because] there may be a gap in security or convenience,\" says michael crane, head of vehicle body and security for the automotive supplier continental. the limitations of current virtual-key technology are among crane's top concerns. for instance, the model 3 virtual key relies on bluetooth low energy, or ble, to connect with the car. but ble doesn't work unless the phone is turned on and the tesla app is open and active on the phone. our testers occasionally found themselves unable to open the model 3's door when they had closed the app-the modern equivalent of fumbling for keys at the bottom of a purse. there are other drawbacks to virtual keys. what happens when your smartphone battery dies? can you still access and drive your car if you lose your phone? and what do you do when you leave your car with a parking attendant, say, in a public garage or at a venue with valet parking, or take it to a car wash?. the tesla keycard given those scenarios, tesla provides model 3 owners with a backup keycard (shown below) to carry in a purse or wallet. (the tesla model s and model x come with a regular key fob.). but the keycard isn't an ideal solution. to lock or unlock the car, a driver must must swipe the keycard along the pillar next to the driver's seat. the model 3 doesn't come with a traditional ignition switch or push-button start, so drivers must also tap the key behind the front-seat cup holders to \"start\" the car. neither spot is well-marked. imagine having to explain that routine every time someone borrows your car. there's also an issue with the smartphone itself: the lifespan of a car is far longer than that of any smartphone, so suppliers will have to work with phone manufacturers to ensure that their virtual-key technology remains compatible over the years. \"the next time i get an upgrade pushed to me by apple, i don't want my virtual key to be inoperative,\" crane says. that's why he expects most cars will still come with key fobs even if they offer a virtual key. automakers also have to be sure that a smartphone-based key is as secure as a traditional key fob, and that requires working with smartphone manufacturers. \"the security of the system is now relying on the security of your phone,\" says karl koscher, an automotive-security researcher at the university of california at san diego. for instance, it might be possible for hackers to access the virtual key of a car owner who has visited a malicious website or downloaded an app with malware. \"the good news is that smartphone makers generally patch known security flaws with software updates more often than automakers fix faulty hardware,\" koscher says. however, software updates can't yet fix some inherent flaws in current smartphone-as-car-key technology, which could make it easy for the wrong person to get access to a vehicle. the traditional keyless entry fobs used by most cars today rely on rf (radio frequency) technology, which sends a radio signal to a receiver inside the car that can determine the location of the key. in most cases, drivers can't start the car unless the key is inside the vehicle. \"within millimeters, we know whether that key is inside or outside the car,\" crane said. however, the latest smartphone-based keys use different technology. the model 3's ble setup can anticipate a driver's arrival and unlock the car from a distance of up to 30 feet, which is shorter than a traditional rf keyfob's range. at closer range, the vehicle can't determine whether the key is inside or outside the car. that means there's a greater risk of the vehicle being stolen as the owner approaches or for a child to start the car while a parent is just outside the vehicle. we left a smartphone equipped with the tesla virtual-key app 5 feet outside the driver's door of our test vehicle and attempted to start the car. even though the phone wasn't inside the model 3, we were able to start it and drive away. (the car would not start when the phone was more than 5 feet away.). during a 10-mile trip without the phone or the backup keycard, no messages on the car's display warned us that the key was not in the vehicle, and the tesla app didn't display any notifications that the car had been driven away. that's in contrast to what we've seen with other cars. nearly every vehicle we've tested will warn the driver if the car is running but the key is absent. for instance, when we tried the same test with a 2018 mazda cx-5 and a 2018 ford expedition-both equipped with a traditional key fob-we couldn't start either vehicle when the fob was more than a half-inch outside the driver's door. we also tested a 2018 chevrolet bolt equipped with gm's keypass ble-based virtual key. although the app let us unlock the doors, the system still required a key fob to be present for the car to start. tesla says that it has plans to improve the accuracy of its ble-based system. the company is also rolling out a software update for its virtual-key function so it unlocks the doors when any handle is pulled and opens the trunk when the button on the lid is pushed. despite issues with smartphone-as-car-key technology, automakers are still moving forward. mercedes-benz has offered a phone-based key for the european version of the e-class since 2016. a similar option will be available on the european version of the 2019 audi a6, although it will be compatible only with android phones. both systems use near field communication (nfc) to operate. unlike ble, nfc works even if a phone's battery is dead. (nfc lacks the range of ble or a traditional rf key fob, so the driver must hold the phone against the door handle to unlock the car and place the phone in a specific spot on the dashboard to start the car.). other automakers are getting in on the action. the lincoln way app for the lincoln aviator, for instance, will mimic such traditional key-fob functions as unlock and chirp, and it can even store driver profiles for various comfort settings. should the phone battery die, the driver can still access the suv using an exterior keypad. this decades-old ford/lincoln feature handily gets around concerns raised for other systems. zipcar currently allows app-based access to its rental vehicles, and some traditional rental-car companies in the u.s. are also pilot-testing app-based access so drivers can check in on their phones and get going without a trip to the counter. tesla has said that its virtual keys will help drivers share their model 3s with other drivers using the company's own ride-sharing platform. although tesla is the first automaker in the u.s. to offer smartphone-as-car-key technology, crane is confident that similar systems will roll out in most cars over the next decade, starting with luxury vehicles. \"i'm absolutely convinced you will see this trickle down from the top, from the premium segment,\" he says, as have many advanced technologies over the years. consumer reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer, and healthier world. cr does not endorse products or services, and does not accept advertising. copyright \u00a9 2018, consumer reports, inc.",

(@elonmusk). there's even a miniature version of the red roadster and driver mounted to the dashboard. several cameras appear to be mounted to the vehicle, so it's likely that video of its insertion into what musk said will be a \"billion year elliptical mars orbit\" will be released afterward. if the florida launch is successful, the falcon heavy will become the most powerful rocket in and above the world. space x plans to land all three of its reusable boosters, two on land and one on a drone ship at sea. update: musk tweeted out an animation of the launch and what the tesla will look like heading to mars. are you following fox news autos on facebook yet?.",

        "body": "tesla model s 'shooting brake' station wagon conversions are a thing. (ares). the world will soon have three separate options to choose from for tesla model s shooting brake conversions. the latest comes from ares design based in modena, italy. the firm announced on thursday that it will produce its own model s shooting brake, and it also plans to outfit the interior with even more luxurious trimmings, too. two other companies have announced their own model s shooting brake conversions. first, a dutch coachbuilder by the name of remetzcar showed conceptual sketches of an all-electric shooting brake. then, united kingdom-based qwest norfolk showed its own model s wagon. of them all, ares' conversion looks the most promising, especially over qwest's rather hearse-like rear end. (remetzcar). in the announcement, the company said ares ceo dany bahar got the idea for a model s shooting brake after daily driving a model s sedan. although he appreciated the car, he felt it lacked more usable cargo space and didn't care for the interior's fit and finish. now, the company will address both of the executive's concerns. (qwest). ares will construct the shooting brake with aluminum and carbon fiber, two elements ares knows quite very well. at current, the model s is stripped down in preparation for new panels and ares leather specialists are hard at work on new trimmings for the interior. the company said it does not plan to alter the electric powertrain, however, unlike some of ares' other conversions. the firm will also be hard at work on 412-inspired conversion for the ferrari gtc4 lusso, which it announced on wednesday. ares expects the model s shooting brake to go on sale in early summer of this year, but the firm's conversion will come at a premium. pricing will hover around the $250,000 to $310,000 range. more auto news from motor authority.",

(culver city firefighters local\r1927) (culver city firefighters local 1927). the u.s. government has sent two investigators to collect evidence from an an accident involving a tesla model s that was allegedy operating in its 'autopilot' mode when it crashed into the back of a parked fire truck on monday in culver city, california. the national transportation safety board said on twitter that the team will be focusing on driver and vehicle factors. the accident took place in broad daylight on interstate 405 when the tesla rear-ended the fire truck, which was responding to a previous incident. witnesses estimate that the car was traveling at 65 mph at the time of the collision and that the driver said autopilot was activated. this is the second time the ntsb has looked into a crash involving tesla's autopilot feature, which is a driver assist system with limited semi-autonomous capabilities. the ntsb in september determined that design limitations of the tesla model s autopilot played a major role in a may 2016 fatal crash in florida involving a vehicle operating under autopilot. but it blamed the crash on an inattentive tesla driver's overreliance on technology and a truck driver who made a left turn in front of the car. the california investigation comes as congress and federal agencies grapple with how to regulate autonomous vehicles and those with systems that are partially self-driving. the systems can significantly reduce crashes, but computer-driven vehicles also can make mistakes. tesla wouldn't say if autopilot was working at the time of the culver city crash, but said in a statement monday that drivers must stay attentive when it's in use. the company would not comment on the investigation. in monday's crash, the california highway patrol and the culver city fire department confirmed the southbound tesla hit the rear of the firetruck but could not confirm if autopilot was operating, the mercury news of san jose reported. the firetruck was parked in the left emergency and carpool lane with emergency lights flashing to block a previous crash on monday morning, culver city fire battalion chief ken powell told the newspaper. the tesla suffered significant damage, but the driver showed no significant injuries, powell said. the model s autopilot is a level 2 on a self-driving scale of 0 to 5. level 5 vehicles can operate autonomously in nearly all circumstances. level 2 automation systems are generally limited to use on interstate highways, which don't have intersections. autopilot keeps a vehicle centered in its lane at a set distance from cars in front of it. it also can change lanes and brake automatically. drivers are supposed to continuously monitor vehicle performance and be ready to take control if necessary. in the florida crash, which killed an ohio man driving the tesla, ntsb investigators found that the sedan's cameras and radar weren't capable of detecting a vehicle turning into its path. rather, the systems are designed to detect vehicles being followed to prevent rear-end collisions. the ntsb re-issued previous recommendations that the government require all new cars and trucks to be equipped with technology that wirelessly transmits the vehicles' location, speed, heading and other information to other vehicles in order to prevent collisions. (joshua brown was killed in florida in 2016 when he and his tesla's autopilot failed to detect a tractor trailer crossing the road in front of it.). the ntsb also recommended that automakers develop systems to make sure drivers pay attention while using semi-autonomous systems, other than detecting the pressure of hands on the steering wheel. the driver in the florida crash had his hands on the sedan's steering wheel for only 25 seconds out of the 37.5 minutes the vehicle's cruise control and lane-keeping systems were in use prior to the crash, investigators found. tesla has taken steps to prevent drivers from using autopilot improperly, including measuring the amount of torque applied to the steering wheel and sending visual and audio warnings. if the warnings are ignored, drivers would be prevented from using autopilot, the company has said. the national highway traffic safety administration, which regulates auto safety, declined last year to issue a recall or fine tesla as a result of the crash, but it warned automakers they aren't to treat semi-autonomous cars as if they were fully self-driving. the associated press contributed to this report.",

(tesla). one example of the car on display also had a large windshield wiper that wasn't discussed in musk's presentation, but looks as if it may be articulated to move almost straight across the windshield, rather than in a constant arc, which would allow it to clear most of the glass area with each swipe. it's not the most elegant styling element, especially on a car that doesn't have visible side view mirrors or cameras.

(tesla). the 2020 tesla roadster is an electrifying $200,000 speed machine. \"you'll be able to travel from la to san francisco, and back, at highway speed without recharging. the point of doing this is to just give a hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars. driving a gasoline sports car is going to feel like a steam engine with a side of quiche,\" musk said. car enthusiasts hoping to get their hands on one of the sports cars will have to wait until they become available in 2020, and pay $250,000 if they want to be one of the first thousand behind the wheel. after the first 1,000 cars, the price will drop to the base price of $200,000, reuters reported. musk also introduced the company's new electric semitractor-trailer. musk said customers can put $5,000 down now but production will begin in 2019. the semi will be capable hauling 80,000 pounds for 500 miles on a single electric charge, and will be more cost efficient compared to a diesel truck when factoring in gas, maintenance and other expenses.. \"we're confident that this is a product that's better in every way from a feature standpoint,\" musk told a crowd of tesla fans gathered for the unveiling. the truck will have tesla's autopilot system, which can maintain a set speed and slow down automatically in traffic. it also has a system that automatically keeps the vehicle in its lane. musk said several tesla semis will be able to travel in a convoy, autonomously following each other. tesla unveiled its new electric semitractor-trailer on thursday, nov. 16, 2017.\n      (tesla via ap). the tesla ceo also said he plans to install a worldwide network of solar-powered \"megachargers\" that can get a vehicle up to 400 miles of range in just 30 minutes of charging. to help customers feel at ease, musk said tesla will also guarantee the semi's powertrain for one million miles. the move fits with musk's stated goal for the company of accelerating the shift to sustainable transportation, but the semi also adds to the chaos at the palo alto, california-based company. some analysts are skeptical given the fact that tesla is already way behind on production of the model 3, a new lower-cost sedan, is still negotiating on a new factory in china and the company posted a record quarterly loss of $619 million it its most recent quarter. musk also has his hands in many different projects, including spacex, artificial intelligence and developing a high-speed transit. \"he's got so much on his plate right now. this could present another distraction from really just making sure that the model 3 is moved along effectively,\" said bruce clark, a senior vice president and automotive analyst at moody's. despite venturing into an unknown market, with the u.s., europe and china all tightening their emissions regulations, electric truck sales are expected to grow from 4,100 last year, to more than 70,000 in 2026, says navigant research. but most of that growth is expected to be for smaller, medium-duty haulers like garbage trucks or delivery vans. those trucks can have a more limited range of 100 miles (160 kilometers) or less, which requires fewer expensive batteries. they can also be fully charged overnight. long-haul semi trucks, on the other hand, would be expected to go greater distances, and that would be challenging as there is little charging infrastructure currently on global highways. without tesla's promised fast-charging, even a mid-sized truck would likely require a two-hour stop, cutting into companies' efficiency and profits, says brian irwin, managing director of the north american industrial group for the consulting firm accenture. irwin says truck companies will have to watch the market carefully, because tougher regulations on diesels or an improvement in charging infrastructure could make electric trucks more viable very quickly. falling battery costs also will help make electric trucks more appealing compared to diesels. but even lower costs won't make trucking a sure bet for tesla. it faces stiff competition from long-trusted brands like daimler ag, which unveiled its own semi prototype last month. \"these are business people, not fans, and they will need convinced that this truck is better for their balance sheet than existing technology. it probably is, based on the specs provided, but this isn't necessarily a slam dunk,\" said rebecca lindland, an executive analyst at kelley blue book. the associated press contributed to this report.",

        "body": "report finds driver, tesla autopilot both came up short in fatal crash.. joshua brown's tesla (ntsb). tesla owner joshua brown was using the semi-autonomous system on a florida highway when both he and the car failed to notice a tractor-trailer turning left across the road. at the time, autopilot was capable of steering the car within its lane and autonomously braking for vehicles in the road ahead. following the incident, tesla said that the vehicles sensors were unable to identify the white truck against the bright sky behind it. according to reuters, the ntsb found that the system worked as designed, but should've done more to ensure driver attentiveness and restrict its use to highways and limited-access roads. the only way that it could monitor the driver was by sensing whether or not he was touching the steering wheel, which the ntsb called \"a poor surrogate for monitored driving engagement.\". the investigation also found that there were 10 seconds to respond to the truck, and that brown did not apply the brakes. his last action was setting the cruise control at 74 mph on the 65 mph road, two minutes before the collision. a tesla spokesperson issued the following statement to fox news on tuesday evening:. \"at tesla, the safety of our customers comes first, and one thing is very clear: autopilot significantly increases safety, as nhtsa has found that it reduces accident rates by 40%. we appreciate the ntsb's analysis of last year's tragic accident and we will evaluate their recommendations as we continue to evolve our technology. we will also continue to be extremely clear with current and potential customers that autopilot is not a fully self-driving technology and drivers need to remain attentive at all times.\". the ntsb issued seven recommendations for the auto industry, including the incorporation of electronic safeguards against improper use of level 2 automated driving systems like autopilot. tesla has updated autopilot's operating parameters several times since the incident. the ntsb report was issued on the same day that u.s. transportation secretary elaine chao revealed the federal government's latest voluntary guidelines for autonomous technology, which includes a section on driver monitoring and the transfer of control from vehicle to operator when a system determines that human interaction is required.",

(ntsb via florida highway patrol via ap, file). the national highway traffic safety administration found that the system had no safety defects at the time of the may 7 crash in florida, and that it was primarily designed to prevent rear-end collisions, spokesman bryan thomas said thursday. investigators also reviewed a crash on the pennsylvania turnpike in which two people were injured, as well as dozens of other crashes involving autopilot in which air bags were deployed, thomas said. tesla won't be fined, but the agency criticized tesla for calling the system autopilot. it found there was no safety defect at the time of the may crash, thomas said. the probe began june 28, nearly two months after a driver using autopilot in a tesla model s died when it failed to spot a tractor-trailer crossing the car's path on a highway in williston, florida, near gainesville. tesla's autopilot system uses cameras, radar and computers to detect objects and automatically brake if the car is about to hit something. it also can steer the car to keep it centered in its lane. the company said that before autopilot can be used, drivers must acknowledge that it's an \"assist feature\" that requires both hands on the wheel at all times. drivers also must be prepared to take over at any time, tesla has said. the lack of a recall is good news for tesla because the agency is either blaming the crash on human error or it doesn't see the recall as necessary because tesla software updates have already addressed the problem, said karl brauer, executive publisher of kelley blue book. \"either one reflects well on tesla,\" he said. but the agency's findings are likely to influence how automakers market semi-autonomous systems. just about every auto company has or is working on similar systems as they move toward self-driving cars. the may 7 crash killed former navy seal joshua brown, 40, of canton, ohio. tesla, which collects data from its cars via the internet, said at the time that the cameras on brown's model s sedan failed to distinguish the white side of a turning tractor-trailer from a brightly lit sky and that neither the car nor brown applied the brakes. scenarios in which another vehicle crossed the sedan's path were beyond the capabilities of the system, thomas said thursday on a conference call. the closure of the investigation without a recall \"helps clarify that cars are still supposed to be driven by attentive people, and if people behind the wheel aren't attentive, it's not the technology's fault,\" brauer said. that will help avoid the stigma that the technology causes accidents, he said. thomas highlighted two conclusions from the investigation. first, that advanced automated driving systems still require \"continual and full attention of a driver\" who should be prepared to take action. and second that manufacturers need to pay attention to how drivers actually use the technology, not just how they're supposed to use it, and to design their vehicles \"with the inattentive driver in mind.\". tesla said in a statement that it appreciated nhtsa's thoroughness in reaching its conclusion. final report on autopilot issued by @nhtsagov is very positive https://t.co/ksozsrr3l9. in july, investigators asked tesla for information on how autopilot works at intersections with crossing traffic. they also asked tesla to describe how the system detects \"compromised or degraded\" signals from cameras and other sensors and how such problems are communicated to drivers. when tesla released autopilot in the fall of 2015, some safety advocates questioned whether the palo alto, california-based company and nhtsa allowed the public access to the system before testing was finished. the company acknowledged \"beta testing\" the system on cars driving on public roads. consumer reports magazine called on tesla to drop the \"autopilot\" name because it can give drivers too much trust in their car's ability to drive itself. the influential magazine urged tesla to disconnect the automatic steering system until it's updated to make sure a driver's hands stay on the wheel at all times. in september, tesla updated autopilot software to rely more on radar sensors and less on cameras. the update also disabled the automatic steering if drivers don't keep both hands on the wheel.",

        "body": "tesla ceo: criticism of self-driving cars can kill people.. april 30, 2015, file photo (ap photo/ringo h.w. chiu, file).. that claim was put forth wednesday by tesla motors ceo elon musk, who criticized the media for harping on the relatively few crashes involving tesla's semi-autonomous driving system called autopilot, while saying little about the about the 1.2 million people who die worldwide each year in human-driven vehicles. \"if, in writing some article that's negative, you effectively dissuade people from using autonomous vehicles, you're killing people,\" said musk, who expects his self-driving technology to be at least twice as safe as cars driven by humans. the comments came as musk announced that all new tesla vehicles - including the lower-cost model 3 - will have the hardware needed to drive themselves. the talk is bold but experts say it's premature until self-driving cars prove they're better drivers than humans under any circumstances. \"over time, after the technology has established itself, one would expect there would be a decrease in fatalities,\" says raj rajkumar, a computer engineering professor at carnegie mellon university who leads its autonomous vehicle research. \"but this is too premature to make this claim. tesla's technology is known to be imperfect.\". in may, an ohio man using autopilot died when his tesla model s failed to spot a tractor-trailer crossing a divided highway. neither the car nor the driver braked, and the model s crashed into the side of the trailer. federal investigators are looking into autopilot's role in the crash. there is evidence, however, that one day musk could be proven to be right. while currently there is little data showing that fully autonomous cars would reduce deaths, there are studies that show computer controls can cut fatalities. the insurance institute for highway safety said it determined from 2016 police data that forward collision warning alone reduced front-into-rear crashes by 27 percent. automatic braking cut the rear crashes in half and reduced injuries by almost 60 percent. tesla's autopilot, introduced last year, can maintain a set speed and distance and keep the car in its lane. but the technology works mainly on highways and must be monitored by the driver. autopilot will turn itself off if drivers have their hands off the wheel for too long. musk says autopilot has already shown itself to be safer than humans. he tweeted earlier this month that tesla vehicles have been driven 222 million miles in autopilot mode, with one confirmed driver death. by comparison, the u.s. fatality rate in 2014 was 2.16 deaths per 200 million miles traveled, according to government data. the new autonomous system has been in testing for more than a year, and musk said wednesday it could cut worldwide deaths in half if all cars used it. rajkumar was skeptical and called the tesla announcement \"marketing hype.\" he said people should be skeptical of tesla's claims because of the florida crash. self-driving technology \"still needs to prove itself,\" he said, adding that it has trouble operating in dense urban traffic and inclement weather. consumer reports magazine also is concerned about semi-autonomous systems such as those that allow a car to steer itself. the magazine believes automakers like tesla \"should take stronger steps to ensure that vehicles with these systems are designed, deployed, and marketed safely,\" it said in a statement. one criticism of autopilot is that the system gives drivers a false sense of security, causing them to be distracted and unprepared to take control in an emergency. the german government has told tesla to stop using the autopilot name because it implies that cars can drive themselves. musk disagrees, saying the term has been used in aviation to describe a system that assists pilots. the new tesla vehicles will use tesla-developed software and have more sensors. they'll have eight cameras - compared to one in previous models - as well as advanced sonar and greater computing capacity. tesla says the system is fully autonomous and can work on city streets as well as highways. buyers can pay $3,000 for autopilot or $8,000 for the full self-driving system. tesla owners, though, won't be able to give up control of their cars just yet. the company will gradually roll out autonomous capability in software updates every few months, once there's enough data to prove it's safe, musk said. the updates also would have to meet safety regulations in the u.s. and elsewhere.",

        "body": "tesla equipping cars to drive completely on their own.. the announcement made late wednesday by tesla ceo elon musk marks the silicon valley automaker's next step toward selling cars that can navigate the roads without the help of a human. google, ride-hailing service uber and an assortment of other automakers also are working on a range of self-driving cars in an effort to ultimately turn the steering wheel over to robots. tesla has offered an automatic steering and braking system called autopilot in its cars since last year, but that technology is meant to be monitored at all times by a driver. related: uber's robo-taxis struggle with parked cars, left turns. after additional testing and getting the necessary regulatory clearance, all the cars rolling off tesla's assembly lines will have the equipment needed to be fully autonomous, musk said. by auto-industry standards tesla is small, making about 100,000 cars a year, although hopes to increase its production to 500,000 vehicles per year by 2018. musk predicted the technology will be twice as safe as a human driver. but adding the protection will jack up prices on tesla vehicles that already can run over $80,000 depending on what features a buyer wants. adding the software and activating the hardware needed for a fully autonomous car will cost an additional $8,000 - a more than 20 percent increase on the cost of tesla's $35,000 model 3 sedan that is scheduled to be delivered next year. musk said he thinks the price will prove to be a pittance if he meets his goal of improving the technology so it's eventually 10 times safer than a human driver. the cars with the fully self-driving technology will get those improvements in upgrades delivered online. tesla's future cars will have eight cameras instead of the single one currently on the vehicles running the less-sophisticated autopilot system. they will have sensors with twice the range as the current vehicles and have 40 times more computing power capable of performing 12 trillion operations per second, according to musk. \"it will basically be a supercomputer in a car,\" he said. but it's an open question when federal and state regulators in the u.s. will settle on laws that allow robots to drive cars. even if regulations were to allow it now, tesla is conceding it's not ready to flip switch yet, saying it still needs to do more testing and gather more data. for that reason, safety features such as automatic emergency breaking, collision warning, lane holding and active cruise control that are currently available in current cars using the first generation of autopilot won't be immediately be turned on in the vehicles designed to be fully autonomous. those limitations make buying tesla's autonomous cars a \"vanity purchase\" akin to buying a tv offering ultrahigh-definition 4k pictures when relatively little programming is available in that format, said edmunds.com analyst jessica caldwell. \"there's also a risk that by the time all these self-driving features are fully tested and activated, other manufacturers may be ready to roll out more advanced hardware with better capabilities,\" caldwell said. consumer watchdogs have questioned whether tesla's first autopilot system was ready to be on the road after a driver earlier this year using the system was killed when his model s sedan struck a tractor-trailer in florida. tesla maintains autopilot wasn't at fault. government regulators are investigating the circumstances of the accident.",

(youtube via ap). the magazine says in a statement that calling the system autopilot promotes a dangerous assumption that teslas can drive themselves. it also says the automatic steering should be disconnected until it's updated to make sure a driver's hands stay on the steering wheel at all times. in an email, a tesla spokeswoman said the company has no plans to change the name, and that autopilot is safer than cars operating without the electronic assistance of cameras, radar and computers. \"while we appreciate well-meaning advice from any individual or group, we make our decisions on the basis of real-world data, not speculation by the media,\" the spokeswoman said. the magazine's calls come after former navy seal joshua brown, 40, of canton, ohio, died in a may crash in florida with the autopilot on. the system didn't detect a tractor-trailer that had turned in front of brown in bright sunshine, and brown didn't react. the national highway traffic safety administration is investigating the wreck and the autopilot system. naming the system autopilot gives drivers a false sense of security, said laura maccleery, consumer reports' vice president of consumer policy. \"we're deeply concerned that consumers are being sold a pile of promises about unproven technology,\" she said in a statement. autopilot, she wrote, can't actually drive the car, but it lets consumers keep their hands off the steering wheel for minutes at a time. she called on the palo alto, california, company to disable automatic steering until it updates the computer program to make sure a driver's hands are on the wheel.",

(krista kitchen via ap, file). the national highway traffic safety administration on tuesday posted a nine-page letter seeking information from tesla about autopilot and why it failed to detect a tractor-trailer that crossed in front of a model s sedan may 7 in williston, florida. much of the letter seeks information on how the system works at intersections with crossing traffic, but it also asks tesla to describe how the system detects \"compromised or degraded\" signals from cameras and other sensors and how such problems are communicated to drivers. the crash in williston killed former navy seal joshua brown, 40, of canton, ohio. tesla, which collects data from its cars via the internet, says the cameras on brown's model s sedan failed to distinguish the white side of a turning tractor-trailer from a brightly lit sky and the car didn't automatically brake. the safety agency also asked tesla for its reconstruction of the brown crash, and for details of all known crashes, consumer complaints and lawsuits filed or settled because the autopilot system didn't brake as expected. nhtsa said tesla must comply with its request by aug. 26 or face penalties of up to $21,000 per day, to a maximum of $105 million. a spokesman said the agency hasn't determined if a safety defect exists with autopilot. the information request is a routine step in an investigation, spokesman bryan thomas said. tesla's autopilot system uses cameras, radar and computers to detect objects and automatically brake if the car is about to hit something. it also can steer the car to keep it centered in its lane. the company says that before autopilot can be used, drivers must acknowledge that it's an \"assist feature\" that requires both hands on the wheel at all times. drivers also must be prepared to take over at any time, tesla has said. tesla released autopilot last fall. some safety advocates have questioned whether the company - which says the system is still in \"beta\" phase, a computer industry term for software testing by customers - and nhtsa allowed the public access to the system too soon. \"no safety-significant system should ever use consumers as test drivers on the highways,\" said clarence ditlow, head of the nonprofit center for automotive safety. he said nhtsa lacks the electronic engineers and laboratories needed to keep up with advanced technology such as general motors air bags or tesla's autopilot. tesla says autopilot has been safely used in over 100 million miles of driving by customers and that data shows drivers who use autopilot are safer than those who don't. nhtsa's thomas said he won't comment on specifics of the investigation. the agency does not currently have legal authority to prevent automakers from rolling out features if they meet basic federal motor vehicle safety standards. it is in the process of developing standards for self-driving cars. the nhtsa letter came as tesla disclosed that a second crash occurred while at least part of the autopilot system was operating. a driver who was heading from seattle to yellowstone national park told a state trooper that his tesla model x suv was on autopilot when it crashed early saturday on a rural two-lane road in montana, the state's highway patrol said. but tesla said the driver activated autosteer, one of the autopilot features, and no force was detected on the steering wheel for more than two minutes. if there's no force on the wheel or a sharp turn is detected, the vehicle is programmed to gradually reduce speed, stop and turn on the emergency lights, tesla said in a statement. the company said the model x alerted the driver to put his hands on the wheel, but he didn't do it. \"as road conditions became increasingly uncertain, the vehicle again alerted the driver to put his hands on the wheel. he did not do so and shortly thereafter the vehicle collided with a post on the edge of the roadway,\" the statement said. it wasn't clear whether the model x had made a decision to stop at the time of the crash. neither the driver nor the passenger was injured in the single-vehicle crash, but there was extensive damage to the passenger side and the car lost a wheel, montana highway patrol trooper jade shope said. the car negotiated a right curve and went off the road, traveling about 200 feet on the narrow shoulder, taking out 13 posts, shope said. the trooper did not cite the driver, saying he believed any citation would be voided because of the driver's claim that the car was on autopilot. the nhtsa investigation, opened june 28, could have broad implications for the auto industry and its path toward self-driving cars. if the probe finds defects with tesla's system, the agency could seek a recall. other automakers have or are developing similar systems that may need to be changed due to the probe, which also could affect self-driving car regulations to be unveiled this summer. in the letter, nhtsa also asked tesla for details on any modification to the autopilot system that tesla has made.",

(ap photo/francois mori, file). the all-stock bid announced tuesday values solarcity corp. at $26.50 to $28.50 per share, depending on a review of the company's books. solarcity's stock surged $3.31, or 16 percent, to $24.50 in after-hours trading following the announcement of the deal. tesla's shares sank $24.86, or 11 percent, to $194.75, signaling that many investors don't like the idea of the company relinquishing 8 to 9 percent of its current market value of $32 billion to expand into the solar energy industry. both of the companies, located about 17 miles apart in silicon valley, are burning through cash as they try to expand in still relatively small markets. tesla has lost $1.2 billion in the past two years alone while solarcity has suffered losses exceeding $1.1 billion during the same span. yet both have fared well in the stock market, particularly tesla. that's largely because its ceo, elon musk, has been widely viewed as a visionary since he co-founded online payment service paypal. now, the 44-year-old musk is trying to bring two of his progeny together. he is chairman of both companies and the largest individual shareholder in each, with a 26 percent stake in tesla and a 22 percent stake in solarcity. the solar panel company's ceo, lyndon rive, is musk's cousin. tesla is pursuing solarcity 14 months after introducing a battery system that stores solar energy in homes and businesses trying to minimize their dependence on the power grids run by utilities. the battery, called \"powerwall,\" marked tesla's first product outside the sleek and expensive electric vehicles that the palo alto, california, company has been making since 2008. musk said in a tuesday conference call that he believes both tesla and solarcity will be better off if their products are united under one roof and a common brand. if the deal goes through, solarcity will adopt tesla's name and sell its solar panels alongside power-storing batteries, musk said. he reasons many of the people who want to drive electric vehicles will have an inherent interest in setting up cleaner energy systems in their homes and offices. although he said he didn't know for certain, musk estimated about only about one-fourth of tesla owners currently have solar energy panels. if tesla and solarcity are combined, musk envisions a more efficient operation that dispatches just one team to install solar panels, electric car chargers and energy-storing batteries in a single visit. in an effort to avoid questions about conflicting interests, musk and antonio gracias, another tesla director who also sits on solarcity's board, are both recusing themselves from the vote on whether to sell. in a letter to solarcity's board, tesla also said it is willing to make the deal approval contingent on a majority of \"disinterested\" shareholders, which would leave musk on the sidelines. the sell-off in tesla's stock after the takeover bid was announced cost musk about $925 million on paper, exceeding the $325 million gain in the value of his solarcity holdings. nonetheless, he expressed confidence that tesla will end up owning solarcity. \"this is something that should happen,\" he said. \"it's a no-brainer.\".",

(ap photo/mark schiefelbein, file). the palo alto, california, company says one of its cars had an abnormal amount of rust on a suspension part, a problem it hasn't seen in any other car. on thursday, the u.s. national highway traffic safety administration said it asked for information from owners and tesla about model s suspension failures. the agency has not opened a formal investigation. tesla said in a statement friday that the model s with the rust had over 70,000 miles on it and was caked in dirt when picked up for service. the company says it has given the agency all relevant information. nhtsa says it's also concerned that tesla has asked owners to sign nondisclosure agreements about safety issues. the agency says such agreements could prevent owners from reporting problems to the government. but tesla also denied that. the company says it has asked customers to sign a \"goodwill agreement\" when it agrees to fix a problem that wasn't the fault of the car. those agreements make sure that repairing the car is not used against the company in court, tesla said. \"this agreement never comes close to mentioning nhtsa or the government and has nothing to do with trying to stop someone from communicating with nhtsa,\" tesla's statement said. shares of tesla motors inc. fell $6.89, or 3 percent, to $222.47 in midday trading friday. tesla shares are down more than 11 percent over the past year.",

(tesla motors via ap). . . tesla unveiled the model 3 on thursday night at its los angeles design studio. it doesn't go on sale until late 2017, but in the first 24 hours that order banks were open, tesla said it had more than 115,000 reservations. long lines at tesla stores, reminiscent of the crowds at apple stores for early models of the iphone, were reported from hong kong to austin, texas, to washington, d.c. buyers put down a $1,000 deposit to reserve the car. at a starting price of $35,000 - before federal and state government incentives - the model 3 is less than half the cost of tesla's previous models. tesla ceo elon musk says the car will go at least 215 miles when fully charged, about double what drivers get from current competitors in its price range, such as the nissan leaf and bmw i3. prototypes shown thursday night looked like a shorter version of tesla's model s sedan. the model 3 has a panoramic glass roof and an elongated hood. inside, it seats five adults and has the same large touchscreen dashboard as other teslas. it also has tesla's suite of semi-autonomous driving features, including automatic lane changing and lane keeping. musk said it will accelerate from zero to 60 in less than 6 seconds. musk said the car is on schedule to go on sale at the end of 2017, eliciting a cheer from the crowd of around 800 people. tesla has a history of missing deadlines for its vehicles to hit the market. \"i do feel fairly confident it will be next year,\" musk said. the model 3 is the most serious test yet of 13-year-old tesla's ability to go from a niche player to a full-fledged automaker. it could be the car that finally makes electrics mainstream - or consumers could continue to be skeptical that electrics will work for everyday use. in the u.s., they still make up less than 1 percent of annual sales. either way, the model 3 is already changing the industry, spurring competitors to speed development of electric cars and improve their battery range. general motors co. is set to start selling the chevrolet bolt electric car at the end of this year. the bolt will have a similar price tag and a 200-mile range. hyundai's ioniq, which has a 110-mile electric range and could match tesla on price, goes on sale this fall. audi will follow with an electric suv in 2018. musk said last month he's not worried. he thinks the model 3 will compete most directly with small luxury cars such as the audi a4 and the bmw 3 series. musk said tesla will expand its stores and its fast-charging supercharger stations globally in order to support the model 3. he said the company plans to double its stores worldwide to 441 by the end of 2017, and it will double its superchargers to 7,200. tesla will also add thousands of its so-called destination charging stations at hotels and other locations. right now, tesla sells two vehicles: the model s sedan, which starts at $71,000, and the model x suv, which starts around $80,000. but a lower-priced car was musk's longtime goal. musk said the model s and model x, along with tesla's first car, the discontinued roadster sports car, helped tesla make the money to invest in the model 3. \"we needed to figure out how we, as a tiny company with very few resources, could make a difference,\" he said. tesla lowered the cost of the car, in part, by making cheaper batteries. the company previously assembled its battery packs with cells made in japan by panasonic corp. but tesla and panasonic are building a massive, $5 billion factory in nevada which will supply batteries for the model 3. tesla says the scale of the factory will lower the cost of its battery packs by 30 percent. the model 3 puts tesla within reach of millions more customers. last year, only 2.1 percent of new cars purchased in the u.s. cost $75,000 or more, but 35 percent - or 5.5 million - cost $35,000 or more, according to truecar. the model 3 is a critical part of the money-losing automaker's plan to increase sales from around 85,000 this year to 500,000 by 2020. robin santucci got the sixth spot in line when he arrived at the santa monica, california, tesla store at 3:45 a.m. thursday. by 9 a.m., he estimated there were 200 people in line. santucci has admired tesla for years. when he got his current car, an electric fiat 500, he made sure the lease would run out at the end of 2017 so his next car could be the model 3. \"the design of every other car they've put out is beautiful,\" said santucci, who works in digital advertising and lives in west hollywood. santucci added that he didn't want to wait too long to order a car because the federal tax credit of $7,500 will sunset once tesla sells 200,000 vehicles in the u.s. that is still likely several years away, although a ticker at the tesla event showed orders continuing to rise throughout the night.",

(we got about 225 miles, depending on the weather.) tesla says it will shoot from 0-60 mph in 5.4 seconds; ours did it in 5.6 seconds. and it costs $81,070 after the federal tax credit. the 85d, has two smaller motors, most likely in an effort to preserve range. each motor puts out 188 hp, for a total of 376 hp. tesla claims range of 295 miles, or about 10 more than the single-motor, rear-wheel drive model s 85. and it's slightly faster from 0-60 mph than the rear-drive model at 5.2 seconds. the d adds $5,000 to the bottom line.. the wild model s performance comes only as the p85d with its 691 hp and awd. it now lists for $105,670. that's up more than $11,000 from the previous range topping p85 version. tesla claims 285 miles of range and 0-60 in 3.2 seconds. tesla's autopilot driver assistance system package is standard on the p85d and a $4,250 option on other models. tesla also includes several other convienence options such as navigation and memory seats in this package that drive prices up from those levels. all prices include delivery and documentation. now may be a great time to get a rare discount on a new or nearly new tesla model s. of course, a discounted 2014 model s won't have autopilot or all-wheel drive, but it is still a top-rated luxury car. -eric evarts with seung min yu. copyright \u00a9 2005-2014 consumers union of u.s., inc. no reproduction, in whole or in part, without written permission. consumer reports has no relationship with any advertisers on this site.",

with its roof sheared off completely - had come to rest in a nearby yard hundreds of feet from the crash site, assistant chief danny wallace of the williston fire department told the associated press. the driver was pronounced dead, \"signal 7\" in the local firefighters' jargon, and they respectfully covered the wreckage and waited for crash investigators to arrive. the company said this was the first known death in over 130 million miles of autopilot operation. it said the nhtsa investigation is a preliminary inquiry to determine whether the system worked as expected. tesla says that before autopilot can be used, drivers have to acknowledge that the system is an \"assist feature\" that requires a driver to keep both hands on the wheel at all times. drivers are told they need to \"maintain control and responsibility for your vehicle\" while using the system, and they have to be prepared to take over at any time, the statement said. autopilot makes frequent checks, making sure the driver's hands are on the wheel, and it gives visual and audible alerts if hands aren't detected, and it gradually slows the car until a driver responds, the statement said. the autopilot mode allows the model s sedan and model x suv to steer itself within a lane, change lanes and speed up or slow down based on surrounding traffic or the driver's set speed. it can automatically apply brakes and slow the vehicle. it can also scan for parking spaces and parallel park on command. tesla conceded that the autopilot feature is not perfect, but said in the statement that it's getting better all the time. \"when used in conjunction with driver oversight, the data is unequivocal that autopilot reduces driver workload and results in a statistically significant improvement in safety,\" the company said. nhtsa's office of defects is handling the investigation. the opening of the preliminary evaluation shouldn't be construed as a finding that the government believes the model s is defective, nhtsa said in a statement. the tesla death comes as nhtsa is taking steps to ease the way onto the nation's roads for self-driving cars, an anticipated sea-change in driving where tesla has been on the leading edge. self-driving cars have been expected to be a boon to safety because they'll eliminate human errors. human error is responsible for about 94 percent of crashes. musk has been bullish about autopilot, even as tesla warns owners the feature is not for all conditions and not sophisticated enough for the driver to check out. this spring, musk said the feature reduced the probability of having an accident by 50 percent, without detailing his calculations. in january, he said that autopilot is \"probably better than a person right now.\". one of tesla's advantages over competitors is that its thousands of cars feed real-world performance information back to the company, which can then fine-tune the software that runs autopilot. this is not the first time automatic braking systems have malfunctioned, and several have been recalled to fix problems. in november, for instance, toyota had to recall 31,000 full-sized lexus and toyota cars because the automatic braking system radar mistook steel joints or plates in the road for an object ahead of the car and put on the brakes. the technology relies on multiple cameras, radar, laser and computers to sense objects and determine if they are in the car's way, said mike harley, an analyst at kelley blue book. systems like tesla's, which rely heavily on cameras, \"aren't sophisticated enough to overcome blindness from bright or low contrast light,\" he said. harley called the death unfortunate and said more deaths can be expected as the autonomous technology is refined. shares of tesla motors inc. fell $6.77, or 3.2 percent, in after-hours trading after news of the crash was released. during the trading day, the stock was up 1 percent at $212.28. karl brauer, a senior analyst with kelley blue book, said the accident is a huge blow to tesla's reputation. \"they have been touting their safety and they have been touting their advanced technology,\" he said. \"this situation flies in the face of both.\". brauer said tesla will have to repair the damage in two ways. first, the company needs to make sure its customers understand that autopilot is meant to assist drivers, not to fully take over for them. second, the company should update the cars' software so autopilot will turn off if it senses the driver's hands aren't on the wheel for a certain period of time. mercedes-benz's driver assist system is among those that require drivers' hands to be on the wheel.",

        "body": "early-build tesla model x suvs face quality issues.. (reuters). the 75-year-old retiree planned to drive it across the country with his wife and son to their home in new rochelle, n.y. but the new-car gleam of karpf's $138,000 titanium-on-beige p90d model x faded with a string of problems as soon as he left the factory-delaying his journey. one of the wildly designed, upswinging \"falcon wing\" rear doors failed to close. the other falcon wing door failed to open, except from the inside. one falcon door didn't sense an overhang and bashed into it, leaving a ding in the door. the driver's door window wouldn't motor down properly, until it dislodged a piece of chrome stripping that was restricting its progress. all these problems required separate visits to the factory in fremont and service center in santa monica, both of which karpf noted handled the problems quickly and completely. in addition, there are manufacturing design issues. for example, the model x's uniquely curved windshield has resulted in \"double vision\" distortion of headlights, taillights, and streetlamps at night. the effect is distracting and tiring, and it makes following distances difficult to gauge. then there was an autopilot self-driving issue that occurred when the road's shoulder fell away; karpf's car became confused, requiring karpf to take command. lastly, the model x's heating system was insufficient to keep the suv warm on a brisk lake tahoe evening. \"when you don't have climate control on, with three people in the car, things can get a bit testy in there,\" karpf says. karpf is not alone. tesla message boards are already swelling with complaints from model x owners regarding balky doors, interior trim-piece tolerances, paint-spray quality, malfunctioning second-row seats, sheet-metal panel gaps, and climate control issues. the model x is still very early in production, with only a few thousand vehicles produced to date. tesla also has conducted a recall of 2,700 model x units for a third-row seat latch that did not fasten properly-a potential safety issue. in response to consumer reports' questions about these quality issues, a tesla spokeswoman wrote in an email: \"we are committed to making the world's most reliable cars. while we have seen some issues with early model x builds, the issues are not widespread, and we are working closely with each owner to respond quickly and proactively to address any problems. we will continue to do so until each customer is fully satisfied. this commitment is one of the reasons why 98 percent of our customers say they will buy another tesla as their next car.\". such issues are expected from a brand-new model. consumer reports recommends against buying a vehicle in its first year of production-especially a ground-up vehicle with the incredible complexity of a tesla. even the toyota prius, noted for bulletproof reliability, slipped slightly during its 2010 redesign. in this case, the model x shares underpinnings with the model s sedan, but it also features numerous features not seen in the sedan. in consumer reports' most recent annual reliability survey, the model s sedan had a worse than average overall problem rate, and it quite nearly indexed as much-worse than average. the main problem areas involved the drivetrain, power equipment, charging equipment, giant ipad-like center console, and body and sunroof squeaks, rattles, and leaks. consumer reports releases reliability data in the fall. the problems have involved not only new-from-factory 2015 model s units, which grew in complexity with the addition of all-wheel drive and new infotainment features, but also with older models that are beginning to see years of wear and tear take their toll. (see more details on our tesla model s model page.). the saving grace for owners has been tesla's attention to customer service. almost every survey respondent made note of tesla's rapid response and repair time, despite the lack of a traditional dealer service network. for its early adopters, tesla has made a practice of overdelivering on service problems under the factory warranty. one reason: for warranty issues, tesla now covers tow costs for up to 500 miles to the nearest tesla service center in north america. tesla also claims that, because the factory, service centers, and engineering and design teams all work from the same platforms, it can address issues and implement scalable fixes at a rate that's unprecedented across the industry. tesla said in its earnings report for last year that \"the cost of first-year repair claims on cars produced in 2015 was at about half the level of cars produced in 2014, and about one quarter the level of cars produced in 2012.\". however, as the units in operation continue to multiply, the question arises of whether tesla can keep up with the service issues-especially when the model 3 compact sedan starts production en masse in late 2017. tesla owners like karpf typically identify themselves as early adopters willing to put up with being beta testers for new technology. when asked if he would endure such issues if the car carried a lexus or mercedes-benz badge, he chuckles. but karpf does not regret his purchase. \"this thing is beautiful,\" he says. \"the car's power is incredible. it handles fantastic. it's hard to believe it's almost three tons. i'm rather impressed with the car overall.\". copyright \u00a9 2005-2016 consumers union of u.s., inc. no reproduction, in whole or in part, without written permission. consumer reports has no relationship with any advertisers on this site.",

        "body": "$35,000 model 3 is tesla's biggest test yet.. it's staking its future on something more affordable. tesla plans to unveil its model 3 electric car thursday night at its los angeles design studio. at a starting price of $35,000 - before federal and state government incentives - the model 3 is less than half the cost oftesla's previous models. the car is expected to have a range of at least 200 miles when fully charged, about double what drivers get from competitors in its price range, such as the nissan leaf and bmw i3. the model 3 is the most serious test yet of 13-year-old tesla's ability to go from a niche player to a full-fledged automaker. it could be the car that finally makes electrics mainstream - or customers could be scared off by tesla's limited number of stores and service centers. either way, the model 3 is already changing the industry, spurring competitors to speed development of electric cars and improve their battery range. \"the model 3 is going to be a pivotal model for tesla,\" said patrick min, a senior analyst with the car buying site truecar.com. tesla didn't release details about the car before the event. potential buyers could start putting down $1,000 deposits thursday for the model 3. it's scheduled to go on sale at the end of next year. right now, tesla sells two vehicles: the model s sedan, which starts at $71,000, and the model x suv, which starts around $80,000. but a lower-priced car has been a longtime goal of tesla ceo elon musk. in a 2006 blog post, musk said tesla planned to build \"a wide range of models, including affordably priced family cars\" in order to speed the world toward a solar-powered future. the model 3 puts tesla within reach of millions more customers. last year, only 2.1 percent of new cars purchased in the u.s. cost $75,000 or more, but 35 percent - or 5.5 million - cost $35,000 or more, according to truecar. the model 3 is a critical part of the money-losing automaker's plan to increase sales from around 85,000 this year to 500,000 by 2020. but tesla faces several hurdles. u.s. buyers remain skeptical of electric cars, and low gas prices haven't helped already anemic sales. sales of new electric vehicles grew 6 percent in the u.s. last year, but they still remain less than 1 percent of the overall vehicle market, according to ihs automotive. tesla also faces growing competition from big, deep-pocketed rivals like general motors co. here's what we know about the model 3:. when will it go on sale? tesla has said it expects to start model 3 production at its fremont, california, factory at the end of 2017. but the company has a history of delays. the model x, which went on sale last fall, was initially due to go on sale in early 2014. musk said last month that the model 3, unlike the model x, is designed for \"ease of manufacturing.\" still, some analysts are doubtful. morgan stanley auto analyst adam jonas thinks tesla won't start building the model 3 until the end of 2018. who are its competitors? general motors is set to start selling the chevrolet bolt electric car at the end of this year, a full year before the model 3. the bolt will have a similar price tag and a 200-mile range. hyundai's ioniq, which has a 110-mile electric range and could match tesla on price, goes on sale this fall. audi will follow with an electric suv in 2018. musk said last month he's not worried. he thinks the model 3 will compete most directly with small luxury cars like the audi a4 and the bmw 3 series. how did tesla make the model 3 less expensive? cheaper batteries. tesla previously assembled its battery packs with battery cells made in japan by panasonic corp. but tesla and panasonic are building a massive, $5 billion factory in nevada which will supply batteries for the model 3. tesla says the scale of the factory will lower the cost of its battery packs by 30 percent.",

(tesla). at an unveiling for the final beta test version of the all-electric model s, the palo alto-based automaker announced that it will be offering a high-performance version of the seven-seat car to compete with the likes of the bmw m5. the range topping model is expected to carry a price tag of approximately $87,400 and be capable of accelerating from zero to 60 mph in 4.6 seconds and offer a range of up to 300 miles per charge. top speed will be limited to 130 mph. the base $57,400 model s will be slightly slower, but have a range of just 160 miles. versions with larger battery packs in 230 or 320 mile ranges will also be available for $10,000 and $20,000 more. when the car was first proposed three years ago, company founder elon musk claimed it would have a maximum range of 300 miles, but an ultra aerodynamic wheel design has allowed it to surpass that figure in epa testing. the model s was developed with help from a $465 million loan from the department of energy and will be built at a factory in fremont, california once jointly run by general motors and toyota to build compact cars. although it appears to be a four-door sedan, it is actually a hatchback and features two rear-facing seats in the back that can accommodate passengers up to 4 ft 11 inches. the highlight of its luxury interior is a 4g-enabled infotainment system with a 17-inch display. according to greencarreports, tesla will also be installing commercial fast chargers in several locations along interstate 5 on the west coast of the united states that are capable of recharging even the largest 85 kilowatt-hour battery pack in less than an hour. for perspective, the much smaller 24 kwh battery in the nissan leaf needs 30 minutes to reach an 80 percent state of charge on a fast charger and has an epa-rated range of just 73 miles on a full battery. using a 240-volt home charging station, tesla says the model s should take about 5 hours to fill up. musk also surprised reporters at the event by announcing that a crossover version of the model s called the model x would be revealed before the end of this year. autocar reports that tesla manufacturing chief gilbert passan said that the factory \"had been fitted and equipped with the ability to manufacture multiple body styles off the same platform from its conception.\" musk added that \"the time is right to unveil the car.\". sales of tesla's first car, the two-seat roadster, which was engineered and is built with help from lotus cars in the united kingdom, are set to end this year when a waiver for its lack of a smart airbag system expires. click here for more from foxnews.com autos.",

(the vehicle production group). after years of market dominance by the big 3, startups like tesla, fisker and coda automotive are hitting the scene, hoping to fill niches with their high-tech battery-powered cars before the big guys can. but today they were joined by another u.s. company going after a very different segment of customers with something a bit more old-fashioned: a van. not just any van, the mv-1 is billed as the first vehicle designed from the ground up with the americans with disabilities act guidelines in mind. featuring a sliding door, built-in ramp and a wheelchair restraint system, it can accommodate passengers using wheelchairs and other assistance devices without requiring an aftermarket conversion. the name stands for mobility vehicle one. the company behind the mv-1, miami-based vehicle production group, has contracted am general to produce the minivan-sized vehicle at its mishawaka, indiana facility where it once built hummers. at a press conference marking the official launch of the mv-1, am general's president of commercial business, rick smith, hailed the effort as an innovative example of creating jobs for americans, adding that \"everyone at am general is proud to be a part of the mv-1 story.\". development of the mv-1 began in 2007 when it was known as the standard taxi, before being redesigned as a retail vehicle. it survived the collapse of the u.s. automotive industry with backing from perseus, a washington, d.c.-based venture capital firm. along with private individuals, vpg is still targeting the mv-1 at municipal paratransit systems and the taxi market. new york city will decide next month whether or not to approve it for use in the city's yellow cab fleet. foxnews.com autos is on twitter. follow us @foxcarreport. according to vpg ceo dave schembri there are 10 million people in the united states that need an ambulatory aid, including 4 million who use wheelchairs. with 1.5 million adapted vehicles currently on the road, vpg's goal is to sell 12,000 in 2012 and up to 30,000 per year after that. sales of the mv-1 began today online and at 41 dealers across the nation, and deliveries are set to begin this month. the base price is $39,950, which vpg says is $10,000 less than a typical conversion van. the first production mv-1 was given to mark buoniconti, a former college football player who suffered a paralyzing injury during a game and now works as an advocate for the disabled and the mv-1. foxnews.com was one of the first media outlets to drive a pre-production mv-1 last year and found it to have the interior ambiance of a commercial van and the ride quality of a full-size suv, but with easy to use assistive equipment that allowed our passenger in a wheelchair to maneuver into it and throughout the cabin without any problems. as of now, vpg does not offer the mv-1 with hand controls, but says that it can be modified to use them. and while the gasoline-fueled ford v8 that powers the mv-1 isn't as cutting edge as the other new american cars hitting the road these days, it does have green credentials. thanks in part to a $50 million loan from the department of energy, a version of it is available that runs on cheap, clean-burning compressed natural gas. it's a $9,000 option, but one of only two factory-direct cars that runs on cng. and the only one that has a ramp. click here for more from foxnews.com autos.",

        "body": "7 dream cars for the holidays.. consumer reports' engineers and editors drive well over 100 new cars every year, and we've found many exotics don't live up to the image. here are seven dream machines that do, listed in in ascending order of price. you don't have to be made of money to dream of owning a mustang. and after sampling several updated 2015 models, so far they live up to the legend. spirited handling, an accommodating interior, and power galore are mustang hallmarks. and they're all here, no matter which engine you choose. purists will pine for the mustang gt with its walloping 435-hp v8. but the humbler engine choices are hardly a compromise, whether you pick the punchy 300-hp v6 or the new 310-hp turbocharged four-cylinder. the interior is more spacious and decidedly less low-rent than the outgoing car, with a well-balanced mix of high-quality materials, modern amenities, and old-school charm. as always, sun lovers can also choose a convertible. the mustang is the car you lusted for as a kid, and it is has grown into the stallion that can live up to your fantasies. razor-sharp handling, a mighty hammer of slick six-cylinder turbo power, and right-now brakes all helped this littlest bmw shine against every other sports car in our testing-especially at its price. that includes the poster-boy porsche 911 and the muscle-bound chevrolet corvette. a little jittery but never harsh, the ride is extremely civilized for a sports car. inside, the seats and controls fit most enthusiasts like a custom tailored suit. it even has a modest back seat that's useable in a pinch. look for a convertible to land at dealerships this spring. ranking second among luxury sedans in our tests only to the tesla model s, the mercedes-benz e-class succeeds for many of the same reasons: it coddles occupants in quiet tranquility, slices corners with confident precision, and with its diesel engine, it sips less fuel than some basic four-cylinder sedans, at 30 mpg. you can also choose a gas-powered v6 or v8 that is even quieter and smoother, with thoroughbred acceleration. and e-class now caters to dreamers in the north country, with all-wheel drive optional even with the diesel engine. a staff favorite, the e-class puts comfort, function, and good reflexes over glitzy flash. it isn't overtly sporty, yet it proves at least as capable on the track as many competitors that claim to be sports sedans. the x5 is the ultimate road machine that can do everything you need and never break a sweat. its quick, linear steering and responsive handling never leaves you feeling like you're piloting a bus. the turbocharged six-cylinder engine gives you turbine-like thrust in any gear. if you want more power or better fuel economy, you can opt for a throaty v8 or a torquey diesel. even the gas-powered six-cylinder gets a 21 mpg overall - the best of any luxury suv we've tested that isn't a hybrid or a diesel. the x5 treads gracefully over broken pavement. and it has two miniscule third-row seats for emergency carpool duty. no matter how many kids you have yelling in the back, the x5's available forward-collision warning and surround-view camera help make calm out of chaos - and you might just avoid an accident. just be careful with the options list; things add up so quickly that you can think of the base price as practically just a teaser. the seventh generation of this american performance icon holds its own against european machinery that costs half again as much. even in \"base\" stingray trim, the corvette blasts from 0-60 mph in a beat over four seconds, hits a blistering 116 mph in a quarter-mile, and corners like a banshee with motorsports pedigree. the 460-hp v8 bellows a throaty exhaust bark that's entertaining enough that we kept slowing down just so we could blast forward again and listen to it over and over. chevrolet's mylink infotainment system delivers an essential collection of the latest internet apps for the road. in its latest iteration, the stingray's interior, trimmed in leather and racy carbon-fiber, is finally sumptuous enough to warrant the car's $70,000 price tag. more than the coolest green car on the block, the model s has the goods to back it up: beyond having about three times the energy efficiency of the average new car, the tesla has the power and reflexes of a sports car; the silent interior, cushy ride and creature comforts of a true luxury car; and more space than a lot of suvs. a 200-mile range, fast charge times, and available roadside superchargers with free electricity mean range anxiety is largely limited to lower-budget electric cars. with sleek looks and all the latest electronics that silicon valley has to offer, the tesla checks all the right boxes in our testing, proving you don't have to be geeky to be green-as long has you have the greenbacks. among the most dreamed-about cars in history, the porsche 911 hasn't lost any of its mojo in its most recent redesign. it's still the fastest, best handling, and quickest-stopping car we have tested, with instantaneous responses. more than ever, its reputation as a livable, every-day sports car is well deserved. modern electronics let you plug in your music or destination with equal ease. for such an exotic sports car it's pretty easy to get in and out of and has great visibility. the suspension doesn't beat you up. and it's pretty quiet, at least until you crack open the throttle, when the classic porsche flat-six engine bellows its own unique brand of r&b through the back firewall. 911s have always been fast; this one now sounds the part, as if porsche had been afraid no one could tell. for sports-car buffs, it's still the ultimate dream machine. -eric evarts. visit our holiday gift ideas page throughout the season to find the best deals, time-saving advice, and much more. copyright \u00a9 2005-2014 consumers union of u.s., inc. no reproduction, in whole or in part, without written permission. consumer reports has no relationship with any advertisers on this site.",

        "body": "is tesla selling its cars illegally?.. tesla motors gallery in houston galleria, opened october 2011, with model s on display (green car reports). tesla, you may remember, is selling its electric cars online, not through franchised, independently owned dealers, and delivering them directly to buyers from the factory. in doing so, tesla motors [nsdq:tsla] has removed the two parts of car shopping that customers clearly hate most: haggling and buying. its tesla stores, it says, are simply educational showrooms where no cars are actually sold. dealer groups--who view the approach as a dire threat--do not believe this, and they are both changing state laws and suing tesla to prevent the company from opening its stores. by the beginning of this month, tesla faced lawsuits in four states over its stores. conciliatory, polite. on monday, tesla ceo elon musk weighed in, posting what was for him a relatively polite, conciliatory response to those challenges on the company website. \"in many respects,\" he wrote, \"it would be easier to pursue the traditional franchise dealership model,\" which would save tesla money and broaden its distribution much more quickly. the problem, he argued, is that any conventional dealer has a fundamental conflict in explaining the advantages of battery electric cars when they rely on gasoline vehicles for the bulk of their sales and profits. the 2012 tesla model s is so different from any other car, he said, that consumers require a great deal of education before they can even start to think about buying. that's what the tesla stores do, he wrote: let the public learn about the model s from product specialists--who are not on commission--and, critically, about electric cars in general. \"their goal and the sole metric of their success is to have you enjoy the experience of visiting so much that you look forward to returning again,\" musk said. contrary to spirit of the law?. he acknowledged existing state laws and pledged that tesla follows them. \"we do not seek to change those rules,\" he wrote, \"and we have taken great care not to act in a manner contrary to those rules.\". in respect to two lawsuits filed against the company, he said tesla believes they are \"starkly contrary to the spirit and the letter of the law.\". musk noted that they were filed in one case by a fisker dealer, and in the other, by \"an auto group that has repeatedly demanded that it be granted a tesla franchise.\". he also noted that u.s.-style franchise laws do not exist elsewhere in the world, and described tesla's plans for service facilities in some detail. laws in 48 states. in 48 states, according to the national automobile dealers association (nada), franchise laws forbid or severely restrict the ability of automakers to sell vehicles directly to the public. the specific wording of those laws varies from state to state, but most are based on the rationale that letting big automakers sell cars to customers would stifle competition. and there's some history--from half a century ago--that supports the notion that franchised auto dealers may face unfair competition from factory stores selling the same cars. tesla motors, of course, doesn't have a single franchised dealer. it has only factory showrooms, and the only way to purchase a tesla model s is to order it online. [update: yesterday, nada upped the ante. it said in an e-mailed statement it was seeking a meeting with the startup automaker to explore \"serious concerns about tesla's intentions.\". its chairman william underriner told reporters the dealers' group \"has 'a whole mess of lawyers in washington' who work on state franchise laws,\" which presumably nada could deploy in every state where tesla has or seeks to open a store or service facility.]. changing colorado law. but dealers insist that tesla's showroom workers are part of the sales process, even though they can't take money for cars. they view that as a violation of state laws, and are fighting the company on several fronts. in colorado, for instance, the state dealer association got a bill passed in 2010 that amended the laws governing dealer operations and their business arrangements with automakers. the bill, which was signed on march 22, 2010 and took effect immediately, prohibited tesla from opening any further stores in the state. as the association wrote in its 2010 end of session report:. an existing provision in colorado law already prevented a manufacturer from operating a dealership so long as they were not [sic] franchised dealerships. this statue [sic] narrows provision [sic] so a manufacturer that has any dealerships in colorado, whether franchised or not, is prohibited from operating a dealership. a tesla store in colorado had opened in 2009, spurred in part by interest in a then-active $42,000 tax credit for the purchase of a tesla roadster. asked for comment on the 2010 colorado legislation, tesla spokeswoman shanna hendriks said only:. tesla's business model was developed in the best interests of consumers and the advancement of electric vehicle technology. in doing so, we have worked closely with regulators to operate within compliance of all current state and municipal laws. that's as close to a \"no comment\" as you'll get. tesla currently has just one colorado facility, in lone tree, south of denver. dealerships: the best way to protect buyers. two weeks ago, tim jackson, president of the colorado automobile dealers association, spoke at length with green car reports on dealers' reasons for opposing the tesla model and fighting its stores. it's really, he explained, all about protecting consumers. he offered three different reasons for the group's action. first, he said, independent dealerships usually continue in business to provide service even if an auto company or brand shuts down the supply of new cars. if tesla were to fail, he pointed out, it would close all its company-owned stores and service facilities, leaving tesla owners without recourse. owners of oldsmobiles, pontiacs, hummers, saabs, daewoos, isuzus, and other vanished makes got varying access to service and parts through independent dealerships long after they disappeared from the market, he maintained. second, the dealers feel--as musk acknowledged in his letter--that tesla could spend its money much more wisely than on building its own stores. imagine, jackson suggested, what tesla could do if it applied the money it's now spending on stores and service centers to its product development plans instead. and third, he argued, all auto dealers will be hurt if tesla fails. if that were to happen, and consumers were left high and dry without a place to have their tesla cars serviced, he said, it would do great damage to the good reputation of all auto dealers. jackson acknowledged that most car buyers have no idea automakers are legally forbidden from selling cars to them directly. he reiterated the association's position that the public is best protected by having independently owned dealerships, rather than direct sales by carmakers. like apple, like tesla. the model for the tesla stores is none other than apple's outrageously successful chain of retail shops. in fact, both companies' stores have been designed by the same man, george blankenship. \"the [traditional] model is that [carmakers] do a bunch of research, hold a bunch of focus groups, and they decide that this is a car we should build,\" blankenship said at the july opening of the portland store. \"they design that car, they engineer it and manufacture it, and then they sell it to some dealer who then tries to sell it.\". \"that's just not how we're doing it.\". meanwhile, tesla has said it had already logged more than 1 million visitors in its various stores by mid-july. and the company is moving forward with plans to open 10 more stores in high-end locations by the end of this year. heading into january, musk wrote, tesla will have 19 stores, three galleries, and 26 service centers in the u.s.--including service centers in cities where it has no showrooms. view original post.",

(ap photo/tennessee highway patrol). the national highway traffic administration says fires broke out in two of the cars in the u.s. after the undercarriage hit metal road debris. the debris pierced the batteries and caused a thermal reaction and fires. in each case, the car warned the driver of the damage, and both escaped without getting hurt. the probe affects more than 13,000 cars from the 2013 model year that were sold in the u.s. tesla has sold about 19,000 of the cars worldwide. they start at $70,000 but often run more than $100,000. tesla's batteries are located beneath the passenger compartment and protected by a quarter-inch-thick metal shield. experts say that if the batteries are damaged, that can cause arcing and sparks and touch off a fire. nhtsa, in documents posted on its website tuesday, said it opened the preliminary evaluation \"to examine the potential risks associated with undercarriage strikes\" on the tesla cars. the investigation could lead to a recall, but a decision likely is months away. tesla ceo elon musk said in a blog posting that the company asked the government to investigate, even though its cars catch fire at a far lower rate than gas-powered vehicles. \"while we think it is highly unlikely, if something is discovered that would result in a material improvement in occupant fire safety, we will immediately apply that change to new cars and offer it as a free retrofit to all existing cars,\" musk wrote. he also wrote that tesla has done an over-the-air software update to give the car more ground clearance at highway speeds. musk wrote that at first, a nhtsa investigation didn't seem like a good use of the agency's time given the higher frequency of gasoline-powered car fires. but he changed his mind. \"if a false perception about the safety of electric cars is allowed to linger, it will delay the advent of sustainable transport and increase the risk of global climate change, with potentially disastrous consequences worldwide. that cannot be allowed to happen,\" musk wrote. he has said previously that the car won't be recalled. palo alto, calif.-based tesla's stock rose more than 400 percent earlier in the year as the model s won accolades from consumer reports and other magazines. but it has fallen 37 percent since news of the first fire was reported on oct. 2. its shares fell almost 4 percent, or $4.38, to $117.20 in premarket trading tuesday. the first u.s. fire occurred along a freeway in kent, wash., near seattle when a model s struck a curved metal object which pierced the shield and the battery. in the second case, a model s caught fire nov. 6 near smyrna, tenn., after the driver struck a trailer hitch in the road. another fire was reported oct. 17 in mexico when a model s burned after a high-speed crash. ___. national highway traffic administration report: http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/ucm446471/inoa-pe13037-1867.pdf.",

(james lipman). tesla ceo elon musk says a recent, negative review of his company's battery-powered model s sedan published by the new york times cost the automaker tens of millions of dollars in valuation and led to \"probably a few hundred\" of cancellations for the car. the outspoken industrialist has pulled no punches criticizing the article, previously calling it \"fake\" and accusing the reporter of intentionally seeking a bad end to his story, which involved a road trip during which he ended up stranded on the side of the road after the car ran out of power. tesla stock has dropped from nearly $40 per share on february 8th, the day the ny times report was published, to under $35 in trading today. but in an interview posted today by bloomberg, but since removed from the news outlet's website (as of this writing it can still be seen here,) musk was optimistic about the future, saying that for every vehicle the company delivers it receives orders for two or three more. in arguing that it's not just early adopters that are buying the car, he said that when a model s is delivered to a new market, reservations for the car from that area increase, suggesting a growing, rather than satisfied demand. tesla currently has 32 showrooms around the world including about two dozen in the united states. the california automaker delivered 2,400 cars in the fourth quarter of 2012, and musk says it is on track to build 20,000 vehicles this year. however, when prompted by the bloomberg reporter, musk said that if it weren't for the $7,500 federal tax credit available to buyers, demand for the car, which costs from $59,900 to over $100,000, would be 10 to 20 percent lower. test drive: 2013 tesla model s.",

typical this time of year for the northeast - when low temperatures are known to affect the performance of the type of lithium-ion batteries used in the model s. broder described in detail how the estimated range dropped faster than the miles being covered, forcing him at one point to set the cruise control at 54 mph and turn the climate control system to low to conserve energy. in a follow-up blog posted on tuesday, after musk originally raised questions about the article in a series of tweets, broder says he drove more than 100 miles below 55 mph. but a data log recorded by the car and released by tesla tells a different story. in it, musk says the car is shown to be traveling at an average of 60 mph during the time broder claimed cruise control was set to 54 mph. it also indicates the cabin temperature was actually increased when broder reported that he turned it down, then was lowered about 30 miles later. broder wrote that he reached the milford charging station, but only after the car turned off the heater completely, and displayed a \"recharge now\" message, indicating the battery was nearly drained. according to musk, that's when \"instead of plugging in the car,\" broder \"drove in circles for over half a mile in a tiny, 100-space parking lot. when the model s valiantly refused to die, he eventually plugged it in.\". after charging the car there for \"nearly an hour\" -- which a graphic accompanying the article clarifies as 58 minutes -- broder wrote the car showed 185 miles of range. he then continued to use the vehicle for the evening and parked it with 90 miles of charge left, 45 miles from the milford charging station. in another apparent discrepancy, musk notes the log shows the car was plugged in for just 47 minutes, and would have left with a higher charge had it been plugged in for 58 minutes. the following morning, with the temperature at 10 degrees when broder got back in the car, he said the available charge had dropped to 25 miles. despite his efforts to recapture the lost energy by warming up the battery, per tesla's instructions, he said he was unable to do so, and drove away from milford to the nearest charging station in norwich, conn., which is not one of tesla's high-speed charging locations. broder said the company informed him at this point that \"pumping in a little energy would help restore the power lost overnight.\" after leaving the car plugged in for an hour, he said he was then told to continue to milford. but he didn't make it. even though he said he \"limped along\" at 45 mph, he said the car ran out of power short of the station. a graphic accompanying the review said the car \"fell short of its projected range and had to be taken to the milford charging station on a flatbed truck.\" although it's not clear if \"projected range\" is a reference to the 185 miles indicated at the end of the last charge in milford, or when it was unplugged in norwich, the graphic illustrated that the car said it had 32 miles of range when broder left norwich, and covered 51 miles of the 61-mile trip to milford before it stopped. musk countered by noting \"the car actually did an admirable job exceeding its projected range.\" he also said the data showed broder in fact did not limp along at 45 mph, as claimed, but at times drove faster. broder also \"drove right past a public charge station while the car repeatedly warned him that it was very low on range,\" musk said. musk makes several other points to support his case, even saying the model s battery \"never ran out of energy at any time, including when broder called the flatbed truck.\". musk also accuses broder of having \"outright disdain for electric cars,\" based on a quote from a previous article where he wrote \"the state of the electric car is dismal, the victim of hyped expectations, technological flops, high costs and a hostile political climate.\". \"we were played for a fool and, as a result, let down the cause of electric vehicles. for that, i am deeply sorry,\" musk says. a times spokesperson tells foxnews.com, \"as we have said previously, our story was fair and accurate. we are in the process of reviewing the specific claims in tesla's blog post and will respond to those when that review is complete.\".",

(1e-race.com). their eight-month, 15,500-mile journey in the tiny electric car is just one of many long-distance ev publicity drives we've seen, but certainly one of the longest. naturally, they're not the only people to have thought of circumnavigating the globe on in a production electric car--and now they're being joined by french tesla roadster owner rafael de mestre. only rafael isn't so much joining the french duo as intending to beat them, snatching the record for first global journey in an electric car. the c-zero team of xavier degon and antonin guy might have started three months ago, but with a range of 50 to 60 miles on a charge, they won't be making progress quite as rapidly as rafael, who can potentially manage up to 200 miles between charges. according to clean technica, de mestre intends to complete his journey not in 8 months, but a jules verne-inspired 80 days. neither team will be the first to drive around the globe in an ev, but the winner will be the first to complete the journey in a production electric car, one with no special modifications above standard. both teams are currently in asia, the citroen duo tweeting as they pass through vietnam, and de mestre commenting that he's just received his chinese licence plates to pass through the country. given how quickly the tesla has caught up, it's only a matter of time before he passes the other team. tesla versus citroen may not be much of a contest, but two things are clear. one: electric cars aren't as useless over long journeys as some areas of the press might have you believe. and two: both teams are almost certainly having a lot of fun, which is what road trips are really all about. click here for more auto news from greencarreports.",

(ap photo/tennessee highway patrol). the blaze on wednesday afternoon engulfed the front of the car. a spokeswoman for the tennessee highway patrol says the model s was headed east on interstate 24 when it ran over a tow hitch. the hitch hit the undercarriage of the car, causing an electrical fire. it's the third fire in a model s in the past five weeks and similar to one in early october just outside of seattle. in that fire, a driver hit road debris that pierced a shield and the battery pack, causing a fire. the other blaze happened in mexico after the driver ran over a roundabout and crashed into a concrete wall and a tree at a high speed. the model s, which starts at $70,000, can go up to 265 miles on a single charge. in the tennessee case, the driver was able to pull onto an emergency lane. no one was hurt. tesla says the fire was not spontaneous. spokeswoman liz jarvis shean says tesla has sent a team to tennessee to investigate the fire. she says the company has been in contact with the driver, who believes the car saved his life. the fire burned the front of the car, according to pictures posted on the jalopnik.com and valuewalk.com websites. shares of the carmaker, based in palo alto, calif., fell 7 percent thursday morning to $140.63. the high-flying stock had risen in value by more than 400 percent earlier in the year, but fell this week after some analysts found its third-quarter earnings disappointing. concerns about a battery shortage, as well as the costs tesla will incur as it builds more cars, spooked some investors.",

(ap photo/paul sakuma, file). it's not just the project's massive scale, the cutting-edge technology, or even the bonanza of 6,500 good-paying jobs. it's how tesla is deciding where to build. through a series of unusual plays, tesla has five states bidding up subsidy packages to land the coveted plant. the winner is expected to offer the luxury car-maker publicly financed incentives exceeding a half-billion dollars. tesla signaled this would be no ordinary competition last fall, when it gathered economic development officials from seven western states and unveiled its vision for a \"gigafactory.\" (\"giga\" refers to the large amount of power that batteries produced at the plant will store.). this spring, ceo elon musk announced tesla would take the extremely unusual step of spending millions to prepare sites in two states - or perhaps even three - before the finalist was chosen. then, over the summer, musk said the winning state would pitch in about 10 percent of the cost, effectively signaling a minimum bid of $500 million. \"we don't usually see companies setting a floor at which states will be considered,\" said leigh mcilvaine of the research group good jobs first, which tracks large subsidy packages by states. for all the public anticipation musk has created, much about the process remains secret. while an industrial park in the desert outside reno, nevada, is one known site, the other - or others - remains a mystery. tesla has asked states not to discuss their offers, and states aren't talking. the effect is a game of high-stakes poker, with the states as players and tesla dealing. \"you can't see any cards at all. do you stay in or not, push more chips onto the table or fold?\" said kim hill, who studies incentives at the nonprofit center for automotive research in michigan. the factory promises something that every state wants but rarely gets these days: thousands of good-paying factory jobs and all the residual economic benefits they bring. so far, nevada, california, texas, arizona and new mexico remain contenders. they have passed tax breaks, promised worker-training funds or proposed shelving environmental regulations that could slow the factory's construction. there is talk of special legislative sessions to sweeten the bids. when the associated press filed public records act requests for documents about the competition with each of the five finalist states, none released much useful information and most refused to release anything at all, citing the competitive need to keep their offers secret. in one glimpse behind the curtain of confidentiality, california provided an email from a tesla official to the governor's senior adviser for jobs and economic development. it contained a newspaper story speculating on a possible site and said, simply: \"this is unhelpful.\" what might be unhelpful was unclear, and the governor's office of business and economic development refused repeated requests to discuss its pursuit of the factory. tesla needs the factory to make cheaper batteries for its model 3, a mass-market electric car the company hopes to sell by 2017 for around $35,000. currently tesla only offers the model s sedan, which starts at $70,000. the tight production timeframe compels tesla to prepare at least two sites, said spokesman simon sproule, who likened the approach to \"an insurance policy.\". tesla will pay about half of the factory's cost; the other major investor is panasonic, which will manufacture the lithium-ion battery cells and invest in equipment. musk has said to expect groundbreaking on at least one other site in coming months and a final decision by year's end. the last comparable bidding frenzy for a factory, according to john boyd of the new jersey-based site selection firm the boyd company, involved competition to attract automaker saturn in the 1980s, at the leading edge of the south's car manufacturing boom. the competition for the gigafactory began at an october meeting at tesla's auto assembly plant in the san francisco bay area city of fremont - a rare approach to opening a site selection process. tesla executives laid out what a winning bid must have: \"green\" energy such as solar or wind at a low cost, an affordable and well-trained labor force, good transportation links to tesla's fremont assembly plant. and a robust package of incentives. tesla required states to submit their proposals within three weeks, an early indication of influence the company would wield. \"given the scale, it was a very short turnaround time,\" said susan st. germain, the lead business recruiter for washington, who attended the meeting but whose state did not make the short list. along the way, there has been plenty of political theater. texas gov. rick perry drove to california's state capitol in a tesla and california state sen. ted gaines delivered a gold-painted shovel to tesla headquarters. cities in both states pitched tesla directly. tucson, arizona, sent the company a preapproved building permit. the director of the industrial park outside reno where tesla prepared land said he's seen plenty of secrecy before, but never anything like this. \"it has been a very, very unusual transaction,\" said lance gilman of the reno tahoe industrial center, which at 167 square miles is the nation's largest industrial park. \"they have played their cards so close to the vest.\". texas has done business with musk before. the state is providing his commercial space company, spacex, $15.3 million in incentives to develop a rocket-launching site. the money comes from what is regarded as the nation's most generous \"deal-closing fund\" of incentives, which has doled out $487 million since 2003. new mexico's governor has said that, if needed, she will ask the legislature to consider changes in law to help land the plant. california gov. jerry brown got lawmakers to pass language helping battery manufacturers, and musk said brown is working to address his concerns that california's arduous environmental reviews would make the project's three-year timeframe impossible to meet. nevada may hold a special session of its part-time legislature to discuss incentives. \"there's kind of a bidding war out there with the state of california and the state of texas,\" said u.s. senate majority leader harry reid, d-nev. \"we'll have to wait and see. i'm not going to start counting the jobs until it happens.\".",

        "body": "tesla says car fire began in battery after crash.. (tesla). company spokeswoman liz jarvis-shean said the fire tuesday was caused by a large metallic object that directly hit one of the battery pack's modules in the pricey model s. the fire was contained to a small section at the front of the vehicle, she said, and no one was injured. shares of tesla motors inc. fell more than 6 percent wednesday after an internet video showed flames spewing from the vehicle, which tesla has touted as the safest car in america. the liquid-cooled 85 kilowatt-hour battery in the tesla model s is mounted below the passenger compartment floor and uses lithium-ion chemistry similar to the batteries in laptop computers and mobile phones. investors and companies have been particularly sensitive to the batteries' fire risks, especially given issues in recent years involving the chevrolet volt plug-in hybrid car and boeing's new 787 plane. in an incident report released under washington state's public records law, firefighters wrote that they appeared to have tuesday's fire under control, but the flames reignited. crews found that water seemed to intensify the fire, so they began using a dry chemical extinguisher. after dismantling the front end of the vehicle and puncturing holes in the battery pack, responders used a circular saw to cut an access hole in the front section to apply water to the battery, according to documents. only then was the fire extinguished. the incident happened as the tesla's driver was traveling southbound on state route 167 through the seattle suburb of kent, said trooper chris webb of the washington state patrol. the driver said he believed he had struck some metal debris on the freeway, so he exited the highway and the vehicle became disabled. the driver, who did not return a phone call seeking comment, told authorities he began to smell something burning and then the vehicle caught fire. firefighters arrived within 3 minutes of the first call. it's not clear from records how long the firefighting lasted, but crews remained on scene for 2 1/2 hours. tesla said the flames were contained to the front of the $70,000 vehicle due to its design and construction. \"this was not a spontaneous event,\" jarvis-shean said. \"every indication we have at this point is that the fire was a result of the collision and the damage sustained through that.\". there was too much damage from the fire to see what damage debris may have caused, webb said. the automobile website jalopnik.com posted photos of the blaze that it says were taken by a reader, along with a video. shares of palo alto, calif.-based tesla have risen more than 400 percent this year. but some investors likely were alarmed that the fire could be an indication of a flaw in the company's battery packs, and tesla shares fell $12.05 to $180.95 wednesday. also contributing to the stock's decline was a rare analyst downgrade. r.w. baird analyst ben kallo cut his rating on the stock from \"outperform\" to \"neutral,\" telling investors that while he's still bullish on tesla's long-term prospects, the company has \"significant milestones\" during the next 18 months that come with risk. the company's battery system and the model s itself have received rave reviews, including a top crash-test score from the national highway traffic safety administration and a tie for the highest auto rating ever recorded by consumer reports magazine. but lithium-ion batteries have raised concerns in other vehicles. two years ago, battery fires broke out in three chevrolet volt plug-in hybrid cars after crash-testing, but nhtsa investigators determined that the volt was no more risky than vehicles with conventional gasoline engines. officials from general motors co. and the government believed the fires were caused by coolant leaking from damaged plastic casing around the batteries after side-impact test crashes. at the time, they said there were no real-world fires in any volts. still, the fires tarnished the volt's reputation and cut into sales. recently, though, sales have recovered. sales are up about 3 percent this year, with gm selling about 17,000 volts through september. earlier this year, boeing co.'s worldwide fleet of 787s was grounded because lithium-ion batteries overheated or caught fire. flights resumed four months later after a revamped battery system was installed. under normal circumstances, investigators from nhtsa, the government's auto safety watchdog, would travel to washington state to investigate the tesla crash. but with the partial government shutdown, nhtsa's field investigations have been suspended.",

        "body": "tesla's 'd' adds all-wheel drive, safety features.. (ap). at an open-to-the-public unveiling thursday night that included bumping music, free alcohol and test rides on an airport tarmac, musk unveiled a new version of the luxury electric car maker's model s sedan that includes all-wheel drive and self-driving \"auto pilot\" features. with more than 1,000 tesla fans in the audience, musk explained that while the current model s is a rear-wheel-drive car with one motor, a new version will have two motors - one powering the front wheels and one powering the rear wheels. all-wheel drive helps grip slippery roads and is standard on many luxury sedans. analysts have said tesla needed it to boost sales in the northeast and midwest, as well as europe. the company sold 13,850 cars in the u.s. this year through september, down 3 percent from a year ago, according to autodata corp. musk said unlike all-wheel-drive systems on gas-powered cars, tesla's system improves the speed, acceleration and mileage by optimizing which motor is used. the dual motor version of the p85 performance sedan will have a top speed of 155 mph, compared with the current 130 mph. it will accelerate from 0-60 mph in 3.2 seconds, akin to exotic sports cars. \"this car is nuts. it's like taking off from a carrier deck,\" musk said at a municipal airport near los angeles where another of musk's companies - the commercial rocket firm spacex - is based. the crowd obliged with cheers and applause. tesla is also significantly upgrading its safety features through a combination of radar, image-recognition cameras and sonar. the model s will steer itself back if it wanders from its lane and brake automatically if it is about to hit something. those features are offered on luxury competitors, as well as mainstream brands such as ford, hyundai and toyota. but tesla is going a step further. its new system will move the car over a lane when the driver uses the turn signal. it will also use cameras to read speed limit signs and decelerate accordingly. volvo has a system that reads signs and alert drivers if they are over the limit, but does not change the speed. musk said \"auto pilot\" does not mean that the car could drive itself - as he put it, a driver cannot \"safely fall asleep.\" although, he said, on private property - not public roads - a driver could summon the car remotely. while the addition of all-wheel drive catches tesla up with other in the luxury car market, pulling together all the driver-assist features impressed brian a. johnson, an analyst with barclay's. \"it's a year ahead of the timeframe i was expecting,\" he said. raj rajkumar, a pioneer of self-driving cars with carnegie mellon university, was similarly impressed but wondered about the limitations of \"auto-pilot\" - how would it perform in different weather and road conditions. the dual motor will be a $4,000 option on the base and mid-range model s, which start at $71,000. the base price for the p85 with all-wheel drive - which will be known as p85d - is $120,000. the cars went on sale immediately on tesla's website; the p85d will be delivered beginning in december, while the other versions begin delivery in february.",

(tesla motors). the company said thursday that by the end of next month, it will triple the number of charging stations it runs from the current eight, and the number will go to around 100 in the coming year, putting stations within reach of almost the entire populations of both countries. the pace of construction is about twice as fast as the company had previously announced. the expanded \"supercharger\" network will allow owners of tesla's $70,000 model s sedans to travel from los angeles to new york, probably by the coming winter, as well as make other long-distance trips. the model s can travel about 200 miles, or for about three hours, when fully charged. with the network, it can be recharged to 50 percent of its battery capacity in 20 to 30 minutes, allowing drivers to make quick stops before driving on. the supercharging stations are about 10 times as faster than most public charging stations, tesla said on its website. currently tesla has eight supercharger stations in california and on the east coast. it has plans to add four stations in california this summer. stations also will be added during the summer so drivers can go from vancouver, british columbia, to seattle and portland; and from austin, texas, to dallas. they also will come on-line quickly in illinois and colorado. in addition, the company intends to add four stations this summer in the densely populated eastern seaboard, where it currently has two. elon musk, who leads the company, said thursday that the stations will always be free for owners of the large-battery version of the model s. owners of the brand's smaller-battery version will have to pay for the option of using the stations. musk said most of tesla's customers don't know about the supercharger stations, and they won't have much of an impact on the company's current sales rate of around 20,000 per year. but they are necessary to appeal to a wider group of more mainstream customers who want to travel between states. \"they want to know that they have that ability to do so, and on a moment's notice, to go wherever they want,\" musk said. \"i think it's really important for accessing a broader audience.\". tesla said by fall, it should have charging stations in most metro areas, with coast-to-coast travel available during the winter along interstate 80. by 2014, the company expects to have charging stations within reach of 80 percent of people in the u.s. and canada, and 98 percent by 2015, it said in the statement. tesla said new technology is being tested now that will allow its cars to be fully recharged in about 20 minutes. the technology will be available at stations this summer, the company said.",

(ap photo/ng han guan). the silicon valley carmaker eschews traditional franchised dealerships for apple-like company-owned stores in malls and shopping centers, and that has made car-dealer associations in several states unhappy. this has led to legal battles and outright bans of direct sales, but until now the federal government hasn't weighed in. in a post on its blog competition matters, the federal trade commission (ftc) declared its support for tesla's direct-sales model, likening it to other technological advances that have changed the way consumers shop. \"in this case and others, many state and local regulators have eliminated the direct purchasing option for consumers, by taking steps to protect existing middlemen from new competition,\" authors andy gavil, debbie feinstein, and marty gaynor said, \"we believe this is bad policy for a number of reasons.\". while this is just a statement of policy that does not constitute any legal changes, it clearly demonstrates the ftc's position on this issue. gavil is director of the ftc's office of policy planning, feinstein is director of the bureau of competition, and gaynor is director of the bureau of economics. these officials argue that laws originally designed to protect small, independent dealers from abuse at the hands of large, national car companies have become \"protectionist,\" serving no purpose other than to eliminate possible new forms of competition. they also said concerns over dealer abuse do not justify \"blanket prohibitions\" of direct sales, noting that the ftc has opposed similar prohibitions of new or unorthodox business practices in industries as varied as wine sales, taxis, and health care. for its part, tesla has previously stated that its company-owned stores were born out of a need to educate consumers about electric cars. in an october 2012 blog post, ceo elon musk claimed the electric car could not get a fair shot if it was sold through dealerships that already made money selling internal-combustion cars. in addition to this \"conflict of interest\" musk felt sales-focused franchised dealers wouldn't be in a good position to explain the benefits of the radically-new model s, because by the time most people go to a dealer, they've already decided what car they want to buy. that's why musk put the tesla stores in shopping malls, where people can be reached before they make that decision. yet tesla almost immediately fan afoul of franchise laws, which exist in some form in 48 states. arizona, colorado, texas, and virginia have banned the stores, while anti-tesla legislation was defeated in massachusetts, minnesota, north carolina, and new york. ohio car dealers also  encouraged legislation that would ban tesla stores, while the administration of embattled new jersey governor chris christie recently changed the state's dealer laws to effect a ban.",

(ap photo/al behrman). ohio is among states proposing to block tesla from setting up additional direct-sales galleries on grounds they undercut traditional auto dealerships. last tuesday, new jersey officials approved a regulation effectively prohibiting automakers from going straight to customers. tesla vice president diarmuid o'connell visited ohio legislative leaders that same day to try to discourage them from passing similar restrictions. \"the bill would shut down our ability to grow in the ohio market and, frankly, it's just a first step to them shutting down our existing businesses,\" o'connell said. \"this is the pattern we see in other states.\". the administration of republican gov. john kasich, through the bureau of motor vehicles, issued a license to tesla authorizing the company to open its own stores in cincinnati and columbus. joe cannon, a lobbyist for the ohio automobile dealers association, told lawmakers in testimony last week that the decision means ohio's longstanding licensing rules \"have been thrown upside down.\". the association filed unsuccessful legal action against tesla's two existing ohio stores, so now is fighting for passage of a bill that would prevent tesla from expanding to other locations. ohio dealers - with 830 dealerships, 50,000 employees and $2 billion in payroll annually - say their businesses can only prosper when the law separates manufacturers and dealers. they view the license ohio granted to tesla as opening a pandora's box. \"the bmv's decision opens the door for all manufacturers - both emerging and existing - to follow the same path,\" cannon told the senate finance committee. \"this decision has serious implications for both our dealers and consumers. from an industry perspective, our members have made substantial investments in their businesses, employees and communities across the state.\". o'connell argues the several hundred vehicles tesla has sold in ohio represent a fraction of the market, which averages about 500,000 cars annually. the decade-old car company is based in palo alto, calif., and sells two models - the two-seat sports-style roadster, at about $100,000; and the model s sedan, at about $75,000. it would like to eventually offer a $35,000 economy model, he said. o'connell said the cars can be difficult to sell so direct-sales are needed to jumpstart electric-car technology and drive down prices. he said many dealers refuse to sell tesla cars yet their associations are fighting to limit the company's ability to sell them itself across the country, including in ohio, georgia and new york. at what it calls galleries operated in maryland, arizona, texas and virginia, consumers can view vehicles but aren't able to discuss price, take test drives or place orders. an arizona lawmaker has introduced legislation that would overturn a sales restriction in place there. o'connell said no u.s. auto manufacturer with an existing franchise dealership has ever sought to follow such a direct-sales model so threats from auto dealers are specious. \"the dealers are simply flexing their muscles, exerting their power to lock down the market and create a de jure monopoly,\" he said. cannon argued to ohio senators that dealerships play an important watchdog role that is lost through direct sales. \"dealers act as advocates for their customers as it relates to warranty, recall and other service-related issues with the manufacturer,\" he said. \"the distinctly different roles of dealers and manufacturers act as a system of checks and balances to ensure that warranty and other service issues are administered fairly.\".",

        "body": "test drive: tesla model s p85.. fox car report drives the tesla model s electric luxury sedan. this despite prices that range from $72,240 to over $100,000, and the fact that in many states the company's brick and mortar showrooms aren't allowed even to tell you how to purchase one, let alone sell you one, due to laws that prohibit company-owned dealerships. tesla doesn't do franchises; you buy its cars directly from the mother ship. but clearly, its slinky looks, lightning speed and a range of up to 265 miles per charge have overcome these hurdles by addressing many of the issues that have stalled the widespread adoption of electric cars, while raising a few of its own. five fires - three caused by accidents damaging the floor-mounted battery pack, one due to a faulty home charger and one that remains a mystery - have garnered plenty of media coverage, but have done little to stop the company's momentum. and there's good reason for that. i recently spent a couple of days in a top-of-the-line p85 - the performance model, with 416 hp, some handling tweaks, a jumbo 85 kilowatt-hour battery pack rated at 265 miles of range per charge, and a starting price $95,740. there are several videos on youtube of these cars beating corvette stingrays and other speed machines on drag strips, and they are no joke. the model s is hilariously quick and a very convincing proposition, even if it comes with a few caveats. a 362 hp version is also available, as is the bargain basement model s 60, which has 302 hp and a smaller 60 kwh battery pack with a range of 208 miles. tesla says the vast majority of its customers are opting for cars with the larger juice box, as it's the main feature that sets the model s apart from other electric cars. a full charge takes as little as four hours at home, but tesla is installing a network of \"superchargers\" at rest stops around the country that can do much faster than that and are compatible only with its cars. you can get about 150 miles worth of electricity in half an hour at one of these, or a full charge in 75 minutes, free of charge. the idea is that on those occasions that you need to drive more than 265 miles in a day, you're going to need to fill your stomach and empty your bladder at some point, and three or more extra hours of driving are your reward. don't eat too much, though, or you may doze off behind the wheel. even with your foot to the floor, the tesla's rear-mounted motor barely makes a whimper, its body cuts through the air like a ghost and hardly any road noise makes its way through the air suspension that comes standard on the p85. the cabin itself is ultramodern in style, airy and comfortable, though the materials trimming it don't seem quite as plush as those found in most cars in this price range. there's plenty of room up front for the sort of professional sport giants and literal fat cats who will be attracted to a model s, but that sloping roof makes the rear seat a tight fit for anyone approaching 6-feet tall. the door openings back there, too, are equally snug and somewhat awkward to get through. it may look long and lean, but the model s is more of a midsize car priced for full-size bank accounts. for such a high-tech vehicle, it's also a bit short on g  gizmos and gadgets; there's no blind spot warning system, radar cruise control, self-parking feature or anything neat like that. but you can be sure the next generation model will be chock full of this stuff, as tesla recently advertised for an advanced driver assistance systems controls engineer. the marquee feature today is a 17-inch tablet-style touchscreen that replaces every button normally found on a dashboard, save for the one that operates the hazard lights - certainly a legal requirement. as these sorts of interfaces go, it's among the best, with easy-to-read graphics and large icons. the problem is that it is takes up nearly the entire center stack, and there is practically nowhere to rest your hand while you're using it. hitting those virtual buttons with an outstretched arm as the car pitches and rolls can be like directing a 10-foot long piece of string into a shot glass on the deck of a party boat at sea. not easy, even if you weren't the one who emptied the glass. the gigantic google maps displayed by the navigation system are hypnotic, however, especially in satellite view. front-seat passengers will appreciate that the mobile web-enabled internet browser isn't locked out when the vehicle is in motion, but it is a little too tempting for the person behind the wheel. as is the accelerator. the millennium falcon's hyperdrive? by the time it engages, the model s has already gone to plaid. whether you're pulling away from a stop or out to pass, the thrust is immediate, plentiful and enough to make anyone a believer in the power of electricity, as if that 9-volt battery you licked as a kid didn't already do that. the model s can do wonders in an s-turn, as well. its chassis is stiff, surefooted and delivers precise handling with tons of grip that's firmly in the spirit of tesla's first car, the low-slung roadster. as far as range is concerned, even though temperatures were touching the single digits on the days i had the car -- far from ideal conditions for lithium-ion battery performance -- the supercharger in darien, conn., worked as advertised and the car went the distance. that said, i was instructed by tesla to keep it plugged in overnight to keep the battery pack warm. if not, it might have used so much energy just to get up to operating temperature that the range would've taken a big hit. better safe than sorry, i suppose, and really, it's the only annoying quirk of ownership the model s seems to present. with an average annual cost of electricity of just $700, a few extra bucks during the winter aren't exactly a dealbreaker, and for those who live in mild climates, they're a non-issue. as for those fires ... while the national highway traffic safety administration looks into things, tesla has uploaded a couple of software fixes through the cloud to address the issues. the first raises the ride height of the cars so they'll hit less stuff that can poke holes in the batteries; the second gives them the ability to automatically adjust their charge rate if they detect a problem with the electricity source they're plugged into. new wall adapters equipped with thermal fuses were also sent to owners, for good measure. but while the model s is still something of a work in progress, it's owners don't seem to care. the used car market certainly hasn't been flooded with them yet, and the company's stock continues its tech-bubble-style climb. that's largely because tesla finds itself in the enviable position of having no direct competition. the model s is still the only all-electric luxury car on the market and the only zero-emissions vehicle that offers anything approaching this kind of range, and there aren't any alternatives of either type on the near horizon. so, while it's not perfect, it's the only game in town. good thing for tesla and its customers, it's also a fun one.",

(ap photo/paul sakuma, file) (ap). the palo alto, calif., company said it wired in a $451.8 million payment to the government on wednesday. the money, coupled with two prior payments, paid off a $465 million loan tesla got from the department of energy loan in 2010 to foster development of advanced-technology vehicles. tesla used money from a $968 million stock and note sale that closed wednesday to repay the debt. the repayment is good for tesla's image because the company no longer owes taxpayers money. and the government quickly touted the payment as an example of a success from an energy department loan program used to start clean-energy companies. the $34 billion loan portfolio has seen several high-profile defaults, including solar panel maker solyndra, plus a potential default by electric car maker fisker automotive. but the energy department said in a statement that losses to date amount to 2 percent of the portfolio, or about $680 million. the department said it has helped to start 19 new clean-energy power plants that have added enough solar, wind and geothermal generating capacity to power a million homes. \"when you're talking about cutting-edge clean-energy technologies, not every investment will succeed,\" energy secretary ernest moniz said. tesla sells only one car, the $70,000 model s, which the company says can travel up to 300 miles on a charge at 55 mph. earlier this month, tesla reported its first quarterly profit. its stock price has more than doubled since the first of the year and closed wednesday at $87.24. also in may, consumer reports magazine said the model s tied for the highest rating in the history of the magazine's auto testing. industry analysts say the success of the debt and stock offerings give the company working capital for the future and are a strong indicator of the market's confidence in the company, led by paypal billionaire and spacex founder elon musk. the payment helps tesla show its independence, said dougherty & co. analyst andrea james. \"it allows them to say, 'we're not dependent on low-interest financing from the government,'\" she said. it also lets musk thumb his nose at critics like republican presidential candidate mitt romney, who in the first presidential debate accused president barack obama of picking \"losers\" for putting money into tesla and fisker. tesla motors inc. is among five auto companies that got loans from the energy department to develop clean vehicles, including fisker, ford motor co., nissan motor co. and the vehicle production group llc. ford got a $5.9 billion loan, while nissan got $1.45 billion. the government is in danger of losing $171 million at fisker, which may soon seek bankruptcy protection, and it could lose about $45 million at vpg. the allen park, mich.-based company got its loan to build wheelchair-accessible vans. about 25 percent of the company's models ran on compressed natural gas, a feature that helped it win the loan.",

(the 60-kwh version is rated at 208 miles.). the model s was lauded for its quiet operation, its acceleration and roadholding, and its efficiency. it wasn't perfect, cr noted, suffering a broken windshield that had to be replaced and a problem with the radio (fixed by a software update that was downloaded through the car's mobile-network connection). the missing point was docked because the model s takes roughly six hours to recharge its battery pack. jake fisher, cr's head of auto testing, put even that drawback in context when he enthused:  \"if it could recharge in any gas station in three minutes, this car would score about 110.\". clearly the cr staff pretty much fell in love with the electric sport sedan. that stands in harsh contrast to its experience with the fisker karma range-extended electric car, which died during a track test and was raked over the coals in a scathing test report. the tesla model s doesn't yet receive a \"recommended\" rating from consumer reports, because the magazine doesn't yet have reliability data on the car, which has only been delivered since last summer. to read the magazine's full test report, you'll have to have a consumer reports login. but you can watch the magazine's video summary above.",

(tesla). deliveries of the first $87,900 sedans are set to begin on friday. tesla had previously promised that the car would go 300 miles per charge, but cites a change to the testing procedure as the reason for the lower official number. nevertheless, the figure is more than triple that of its nearest competitor, the coda, which has an epa rated range of 88 miles. the model s achieves its long range with the use of the largest battery yet installed in a production electric car, an 85 kilowatt-hour lithium-ion pack that would take over two days to charge on a 110v household outlet, but just four to nine hours when using a 240v charger. tesla is also building a network of public \"superchargers\" on interstate highways that can fill the pack half way in 30 minutes. the model s is being billed as a zero emissions competitor to cars like the bmw 5-series, and features a hatchback design that can accommodate a pair of child-size rear facing jump seats in the cargo area making it a 7-passenger vehicle. the 89 mpg-equivalent rating is calculated by comparing the amount of energy in a gallon of gasoline to that used in the form of electricity by the model s. the highest mileage car rated so far is the smaller, less powerful honda fit ev, with a rating of 118 mpg-e. while the first tesla sedans going to customers are top of the line signature editions loaded with options, a more basic $69,900 version will go on sale later this year. it will be followed by two shorter range models powered by 40 and 60 kwh battery packs with starting prices of $49,900 and $59,900, respectively. read: tesla electric suv to fly on \"falcon wings\".",

(ap photo/tennessee highway patrol). ceo elon musk said the fires, which occurred when metal road debris pierced the underbody of the cars at highway speeds, are extreme cases. he doesn't expect a recall and said his engineers are not working on any fixes for the battery-powered cars. \"in both cases it was a large piece of metal essentially braced against the tarmac,\" musk said in an interview friday with the associated press. no one was hurt in the fires, which happened along freeways near seattle and nashville, tenn. starting oct. 1. another fire happened in mexico after the driver ran through a concrete wall at more than 100 mph. musk said no one has ever been hurt in a model s crash, which shows there's no safety problem for drivers or passengers. the only other reason to investigate is economic loss from the fires, but that's not an issue because tesla amended its warranty to cover fire loss in crashes, musk said. \"i'm not saying it can't happen again,\" he said. \"i'm saying in any kind of low-speed impact, you're fine. any car, model s or not model s, the underside is going to get significantly damaged if you drive over a large metal object.\". musk described the weeks since the fires as \"torture.\" he said the crashes have received an unreasonable amount of media attention given that no one was injured. he understands that a new technology such as electric cars will get more scrutiny, \"but not to the insane degree that we're receiving.\". tesla's stock price has dropped by 37 percent since the first fire. some investors and analysts also were disappointed by the company's third-quarter results. but musk said the stock's value, which earlier in the year had risen 470 percent to $194.50, got too high and the market is correcting it. \"i believe i said several times that the valuation was more than we had any right to deserve,\" said musk, a billionaire who co-founded paypal and started spacex. \"i was not the one who thought the valuation should go up to such levels.\". tesla shares closed friday down 72 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $121.38.",

(ok, i'll admit, that's a cheap shot, but you know you wanted it. now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's begin.). the battery-powered tesla model s is officially on the road, thanks in part to the aforementioned department of energy loan, but also the backing of many private investors - some of whom are named brin and page. google it if you don't know what i'm talking about. the first customer cars are in the hands of their very patient depositors, and one or two cars are being built and shipped each day, a rate that will accelerate as production ramps up through the end of the year. by then, tesla expects to have delivered 5,000 vehicles, which won't even fill half of the 11,000 orders currently on its books.  in other words, it's off to a pretty good start. in the meantime, the california-based automaker is taking a small fleet of cars around the country to give their future owners a taste of what's in store while they wait. i don't count myself among them, but did take one out for a quick spin in new york city. the model s is a midsize five-door hatchback with a style that falls somewhere between jaguar and audi on the sleek and sexy scale. if it doesn't look like a futuristic electric car, that's intentional. tesla says that it wanted the technology to be disruptive, not the design. think of it like one of those movie robots that disguises itself as a human so it doesn't scare the locals, then destroys them and takes over the planet. that's the outside. under the skin, things get a bit more technical. flush mounted door handles pop out when you unlock the car, which starts by merely sitting in the driver's seat. from there you are confronted with a hexagonal lcd instrument cluster and 17-inch tablet-style display in the center of the dashboard that is used to control pretty much everything on the car. the only buttons in sight turn on the hazard lights and open the glove compartment. notable, particularly in the pre-production car that i drove, is that the build quality throughout the cabin is competitive with that of established players in the luxury segment. tesla had the infotainment system custom designed and the layout on the screen is highly functional, with large icons, a configurable split screen and a wireless web browser that -- passengers will be happy to hear -- works when the car is in motion. missing are any advanced voice controls, but tesla says an upgrade is in the works. the cabin otherwise presents a conventional five-seat layout, but with a perfectly flat floor and a clear space between the dash and armrest it has a very airy feel up front. rear seat passengers could use a bit more leg and headroom, but not as much as the two seated in the optional rear-facing child seats located in the cargo area. if they are filled, and you need to put your golf clubs somewhere, what tesla calls a \"frunk\" is located under the front hood, a 5.3 cubic foot compartment similar to what you find in a mid-engine sports car. the model s is technically a rear-motor car, with its electric propulsion system located between and just behind the driven rear wheels. the liquid cooled and heated battery pack that powers it makes up the floorpan of the car and is encased in steel and further protected by a plastic cover that also helps give the model s the lowest aerodynamic drag of any production vehicle. three battery sizes are on offer: 40 kilowatt-hour, 60 kwh and 85 kwh, with base prices for the models equipped with each ranging from $57,400-$77,400. a top of the line model s goes for $97,900, and a $7,500 federal tax credit applies to all versions. the largest of the three, and the only one available until fall, has an epa rated range of 265 miles per charge, which takes anywhere from four to 57 hours depending on what type of outlet or charging station it's plugged in to. the others are yet to be rated, but based on tesla's original estimate of 300 miles for the 85 kwh pack, the 160-mile claim for the 40 kwh version could end up closer to 132 miles. in the less than half-hour trip i took through busy midtown manhattan, i didn't have the opportunity to challenge the range, but did get a feel for how a juiced up model s drives. despite its portly 4,600-pound weight, the model s steps off smartly with a smooth and linear power delivery from its potent motor, rated at 362 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque or 416 hp and 443 lb-ft if you opt for the performance upgrade. equipped with the latter, it will keep up with a ford mustang gt on a drag strip. and the muscle car won't hear it coming. the model s is nearly silent, which i personally found a little disappointing as i enjoy a good tron-style soundtrack from my electric cars. luxury sedan buyers will likely disagree. top level models are fitted with an active air suspension that can be adjusted for ride height -- helpful for driving up steep driveways and down snow covered roads. it demonstrated the ability to turn new york city's cobblestone streets into smooth pavement, and conspired with the ultra-low center of gravity provided by the weight of the battery pack's 7,000 cells to make the model s an able handler. flooring it through a u-turn during a light rain shower, the model s responded well and the stability system kept the tires perfectly under control - one of the advantages electric drive has over internal combustion. but simply cruising around town is where the model s makes its strongest case. even those not inclined towards battery powered propulsion would have a hard time finding fault with the ride, and i suppose that if i were the type of person who had put $5,000 down sight unseen to reserve one i'd take the leap and convert that to a real car -- at least one with the big battery. up until now the argument against electric cars is that they are too expensive. who would spend $35,200 on an econobox like the nissan leaf that can go just 73 miles per charge and requires that you own a second vehicle? not many people, it turns out. nissan only sold 535 leafs in june. but what if you can get a very ritzy set of wheels that goes nearly four times as far and costs less than twice as much? now, you might be talking. or not. tesla moved less than 2,500 of its $109,000 roadster sports cars over four years, despite the fact that it was a blast to drive and had a 244-mile range. granted, it was quite small and bare bones, but the market for electric luxury sedans remains untested and there are no guarantees that the model s will pass the muster of the well-to-do masses either. still, while i'll reserve final judgment on the model s until i have the opportunity to take one through a few charge cycles, i am feeling better about the solvency of the company that i am involuntarily invested in. enthusiasm for the car remains high, and on the surface it is an attractive package that, at least initially, does not disappoint. then again, how many times have we heard that said about those robots?. read: (very) quick spin: 2012 fisker karma.",

(ap). panasonic, japan's biggest electronics maker, will acquire about a 2 percent stake in tesla, purchasing tesla common stock at $21.15 per share. panasonic, which already makes batteries for tesla vehicles, said the two firms will jointly market and sell battery packs for electric cars. shares in panasonic jumped 3.7 percent to 1,181 yen thursday following the announcement of the capital tie-up with tesla. apart from panasonic, toyota motor corp. already has invested $50 million in the high-end electric car maker. toyota, the world's no. 1 automaker, has also signed a $60 million contract to have tesla help develop an electric version of toyota's rav4 crossover vehicle. \"it is an honor and a powerful endorsement of our technology that panasonic, the world's leading battery-cell manufacturer, would choose to invest in and partner with tesla,\" said tesla chief executive elon musk. \"we believe our partnership with them will enable us to further improve our battery pack while reducing cost.\". tesla opened its first asian showroom in a fashionable tokyo neighborhood last month, hoping to woo rich buyers before eventually widening its appeal with cheaper models. but the company has not turned a profit since it was founded in 2003, and so far tesla has sold only about 1,000 of its high-end electric cars. it currently sells just one vehicle, the $109,000 roadster sports car, which is popular among celebrities and performance-car enthusiasts. but interest is high in tesla because of growing concerns about global warming and pollution. governments around the world are offering tax rebates and incentives for electric car buyers, and they also won't need to ever fill up at a gas station. nissan motor co., which is bullish on electric vehicles with its leaf set for delivery in december, expect such vehicles to grow to 10 percent of overall global sales by 2020 but other research puts the number lower. current sales of electric cars are negligible. naoto noguchi, president of panasonic's battery cell unit, said the company hopes to build its reputation as a green company. last month, tesla showed a retooled factory in fremont, california, the site of the former joint venture between toyota and general motors co., where it plans to produce its next-generation electric sedan, the model s, in partnership with toyota, set to start in 2012.",

        "body": "tesla unveils its first suv, the model x.. sept. 29, 2015: elon musk, ceo of tesla motors inc., introduces the model x car at the company's headquarters in fremont, calif. (ap photo/marcio jose sanchez). tesla's model x -- one of the only all-electric suvs on the market -- was officially unveiled tuesday night near the company's california factory. suvs were delivered to the first six buyers. ceo elon musk says the model x sets a new bar for automotive engineering, with unique features like rear falcon-wing doors, which open upward, and a driver's door that opens on approach and closes itself when the driver is inside. \"all these things together make the car amazing,\" he said. the model x is the third vehicle from 12-year-old tesla, after the roadster -- which was discontinued in 2012 -- and the model s sedan. it should attract new customers -- particularly women -- to the brand, and it goes on sale as the market for luxury suvs is booming. u.s. luxury suv sales were up 17 percent through august, five times better than the industry as a whole. \"if tesla's going to be a more significant player, they need more products, and suvs are what the market is demanding,\" said michelle krebs, a senior analyst with the car buying site autotrader.com. musk said tesla expects about half of its sales to be suvs. but there are drawbacks. only a fraction of the sippy-cup set will be able to afford the model x, even with a $7,500 federal tax credit. a fully loaded performance model is $142,000; exact pricing of the base model hasn't been released, but musk said the model x will cost $5,000 more than an equivalent model s, or around $93,000. musk said the company will eventually offer a less expensive variant with a smaller battery. the model x shares a platform and motor with the model s, which is made at the same factory. but unlike the s, which has several battery options, the x only has a 90 kilowatt-hour battery and only comes with all-wheel drive. the 90d version will go 257 miles on a full charge, while the p90d performance version will go 250 miles. tesla's high-speed \"ludicrous mode\" is offered on the p90d; it goes from 0 to 60 mph in 3.2 seconds. the model x has three rows and seats seven; on a test ride, the back row could fit an adult and had a surprising amount of headroom. the front windshield, which tesla says is the biggest in the industry, sweeps back and over the front seats. navigation, music and cabin controls are accessed through a 17-inch dashboard touch screen. but the most eye-popping feature is the double-hinged falcon-wing doors. they need less than a foot of clearance to open, and they're fitted with sensors so they won't trap hands or hit cars parked next to them. the doors -- and the tesla-designed second-row seats, which all move independently -- were among the reasons the model x's launch was delayed several times. musk announced plans for the model x in 2012; it was initially expected to go on sale in early 2014. musk says the company \"got a little carried away\" and might have designed the model x differently if it had known the final engineering costs and manufacturing complexity. \"i'm not sure anyone should make this car,\" he said. \"there's far more there than is really necessary to sell the car.\". that complexity means there will be a slow production ramp-up this fall. around 25,000 people have already placed orders for the x, musk said. customers who put in an order now will have to wait up to a year to get one. last month, musk lowered tesla's annual sales forecast from 55,000 vehicles to between 50,000 and 55,000. but musk says tesla is still on track to sell 500,000 vehicles by 2020. it expects to reach that goal with the introduction of its next car, the lower-priced model 3, which is due out in 2017. the model x is alone, for now, in the all-electric luxury suv market. its closest competitor is the plug-in hybrid porsche cayenne suv, which starts at $77,200. but others, spurred by tesla, are planning their own all-electric models. audi said this month that it will have an all-electric suv by 2018. at the lower end of the market, there's the $32,000 kia soul ev, an electric crossover, but it only has a 93-mile range. toyota briefly sold an electric version of the rav4 suv, but that was discontinued last year.",

(ap photo/ng han guan, file). tesla's latest update - which will be beamed to owners automatically in about 10 days - will map out the best route to a driver's destination based on the location of charging stations and will guide the car to available spots to charge. the car will also warn drivers if battery power is low before they drive beyond an area where they can charge. it will take into account elevation, wind speed, air conditioning use and other factors that can deplete the battery. \"you don't need to think ahead and make any calculations,\" tesla ceo elon musk said during a conference call to announce the update. \"the car will always take care of you.\". musk said tesla is also working on an automatic steering feature on test drives between san francisco and seattle. that feature - which could be added with another software update about three months from now - would allow automatic, hands-free driving on a highway with well-marked lanes. the model s can travel up to 270 miles on a single battery charge, which is more than double the range of other electric cars on the market, such as the nissan leaf. musk said owners generally find that's enough to get them where they need to go. but range remains a concern for many potential buyers. \"range is generally one of the issues people have about electric cars, and it is an important thing to address really emphatically,\" musk said. tesla will update model s sedans globally for free. musk said the software will give preference to the company's supercharger stations - which can almost fully charge a model s in 30 minutes - but it will also point out other charging stations along a route. currently, 90 percent of the u.s. population is within 175 miles of a supercharger. europe, canada and parts of china will soon have similar coverage, musk said. the update will also add several safety features, including automatic emergency braking, blind spot detection and a side collision warning system. many of those features are already standard in other luxury cars. musk caused a frenzy last sunday when he tweeted that tesla was \"about to end range anxiety\" with a software update. but he might have raised investors' expectations a little too much. tesla's shares fell $2.80, or 1.4 percent, to $197.91 in afternoon trading after the announcement. karl brauer, a senior analyst with kelley blue book, says the update won't fully eliminate the anxiety over range. \"one could argue such aggressive warnings will only remind drivers how critical it is to get to a charging stating before draining the battery pack,\" he said.",

(tesla motors). telsa has introduced the latest upgrades for its electric model s sedan. the top of the line p85d is now available with up to 762 hp, making it the most powerful american car ever, and one of the quickest in the world. that's compared to the current max of 691 hp, and was made possible through the development of a new type of fuse that allows for an increase in the output of the car's battery pack from 1300 to 1500 amps. instead of a conventional dumb fuse that simply melts when it gets too hot, the new one has its own battery-powered monitor which allows it monitors the current more precisely, and uses a pyrotechnic charge to cut the circuit. to unlock full power, you need to engage \"ludicrous mode,\" a tip of the hat to the 1987 sci-fi farce, \"spaceballs.\". when you do, tesla says it's good for a 0-60 mph run in 2.8 sec and can do the quarter-mile in 10.9 sec, a tenth quicker in the quarter than the 707 hp dodge charger hellcat. the option adds $10,000 to the p85d's starting price of $106,200, but existing owners can get their cars upgraded for $5,000. plan on using all of that power often? tesla is also offering its largest battery pack yet, a 90 kwh unit that costs $3,000 over the 85 kwh pack, and improves on its 253-mile range by 6 percent.

(ap photo/paul sancya). ceo elon musk, speaking tuesday at an automotive conference, said tesla needs to show a profit, and will when it's selling 500,000 cars per year. he predicted that sales milestone will be reached in 2020, when its lower-cost car - the model 3 - is in full production. tesla, which was founded in 2003, has never made a full-year profit. the company based in palo alto, california, expects to sell around 33,000 model s sedans this year. speaking at the automotive news world congress, musk said tesla could make money under u.s. accounting standards \"if we weren't growing and investing great amounts of money.\". in addition to developing the model 3 and a crossover, tesla recently reengineered its model s sedan to offer all-wheel drive. it's also building a $5 billion battery factory in nevada that is set to begin production in 2017. musk wouldn't say how many model s sedans tesla sold last year, citing its upcoming earnings report. he did say fourth-quarter sales fell in china because of customers' concerns about plugging in their vehicles if they live in apartment buildings. musk said that issue is being resolved as tesla expands its network of supercharging stations in china. he added that north america and europe saw a \"significant increase\" in sales. tesla shares fell 6 percent to $182 in after-hours trading. that's down 35 percent from their all-time high of $291.42 set in early september. in addition to the model 3 - which, at $35,000, would cost half the price of a model s - tesla is developing the model x suv, which is set to go on sale this summer after several delays. musk said technical difficulties with the crossover's unique rear doors, which open up instead of out, were the reason. \"i do have an issue with punctuality,\" musk joked. \"this car is really good. and i do not say these things lightly.\". he said he wasn't concerned about competitors, including the chevrolet bolt, a $37,500 electric car with a 200-mile range that was introduced this week at the detroit auto show. general motors says the bolt could be on sale by 2017. \"i don't see it as a competitive threat because i think all cars will go electric,\" he said. \"it's not going to affect us, really.\". musk said he wishes more automakers would take a risk on electric cars. low gas prices, he said, shouldn't hinder their adoption because electric cars are cheaper to run than gas-powered cars even if oil is $40 to $50 per barrel. \"i think there's going to be huge societal pressure towards electric cars,\" he said. \"they're just fundamentally better.\". musk said he plans to lead tesla at least through high-volume production of the model 3. he may not always be ceo, he said, but he will play a role in the company \"as long as i'm alive.\".",

        "body": "tesla responds to chinese hack with a major security upgrade.. (tesla). tesla could have reacted by fixing any one of the bugs to block the attack. instead, it went further, implementing a more fundamental security feature that will make the next hack of its vehicles more difficult for even sophisticated hackers to pull off. tesla added a measure that requires any new firmware written to components on the can bus-the internal network of computers that control everything from steering and brakes to windshield wipers-be digitally signed with a cryptographic key only tesla possesses. the new protection, known as code signing, was pushed out wirelessly in a software update earlier this month to all tesla s cars and tesla x suvs. it amounts to far tighter control over who can reprogram sensitive components. the upgrade makes tesla's in-vehicle security systems less like a malware-prone windows pc and more like a locked-down iphone. \"cryptographic validation of firmware updates is something we've wanted to do for a while to make things even more robust,\" says tesla's chief technical officer jb straubel. straubel notes that tesla has been working on the code-signing feature for months but accelerated its rollout when the tencent hackers reported their attack. the tesla security team pushed the fix to all tesla s and x vehicles within ten days. the feature, he says, should be considered a standard for the auto industry, hardening cars' internal networks even against hackers who have found an initial foothold in the form of another software flaw. \"this is what the world needs to move towards,\" straubel says. \"otherwise the door is thrown wide open anytime anyone finds a new vulnerability.\". why your car's more hackable than your iphone. in fact, code signing has been a widespread feature in pcs and smartphones for years. it's what prevents you from installing an app on your iphone that didn't come from apple's app store and triggers the warning about an untrusted application in windows or macos when you install a piece of software downloaded from the web. but as vehicles have become increasing digital, automated and internet-connected, code signing's cryptographic trust feature has been conspicuously missing from major automotive vendors' digital defenses. exactly which automakers implement the feature is tough to track, given the companies' lack of transparency around security. but the chevy impala that researchers hacked via onstar in 2010 lacked code signing. so did the 2014 jeep cherokee that hackers hijacked on the highway last year in a demonstration for wired. the jeep hack might still have been possible even if chrysler had used code signing to protect the vehicle's can network, says charlie miller, one of the two hackers who developed the attack. but, miller adds, \"it would have been so much harder we probably wouldn't have bothered trying.\". still, major carmakers have resisted recommendations to implement code signing, says josh corman, a founder of the internet-of-things security nonprofit i am the cavalry. that's due in part to their disparate supply chains, dealers, aftermarket tools and mechanics, all of which would be affected if a detroit giant started requiring the same cryptographic validation of software changes that apple does. \"tesla's span of control over its parts and suppliers and dealers may afford a better security response,\" says corman. \"their ability to be nimble is objectively greater.\". how the tesla s got hacked. to understand how code signing stymies car hackers, consider the blow-by-blow of the tencent hackers' attack, which they broke down for wired in a series of emails. the hackers first dug up a vulnerability in the tesla s' browser, which is based on the open source browser framework webkit. that bug allowed them to start running malicious code in the browser of any tesla that visited a carefully crafted website. to demonstrate how a tesla driver could be tricked into visiting a sabotage site, the hackers created their own wifi hotspot with the name \"tesla guest,\" a common wifi network name at tesla dealerships, and enabled access with the commonly shared password for dealership guest networks, which they found on the web. they configured their hotspot so that any tesla that auto-connects to the network would immediately load their malicious page. \"when the browser is on, its web access traffic will be redirected to our payload. then pwn!\" writes samuel lv, the director of tencent's keenlab security team, using the hacker jargon \"pwn\" to mean \"hack\" or \"take control of.\" (tesla and tencent disagree as to whether the trick works without any interaction on the part of the user. tesla claims the user would have to manually connect to the malicious hotspot and then navigate to an infected website. the hackers haveargued the point with tesla founder elon musk on twitter.). the tencent hackers then used another vulnerability in the tesla's linux operating system to gain full privileges on the car's head unit, the computer in its dashboard. but even then the group couldn't send commands to critical driving functions like steering and brakes: the tesla s' head unit is separated from its can bus by a computer tesla calls a gateway, which only allows certain commands to be sent from the car's infotainment system to its driving components. to defeat that safeguard, the hackers simply overwrote the gateway's firmware with their own. without code signing, nothing prevents that tactic. here's their full demonstration video:. a big fix for a big problem. when tencent keenlab team shared its attack technique with tesla earlier this month, tesla quickly created patches for the browser vulnerability and the linux kernel flaw. but it also rushed to fix what cto straubel describes as the most serious problem the chinese hackers exposed: the ability for any hacker who gets deep enough into the vehicles' systems to rewrite the firmware of the driving components. \"the browser vulnerability is not the real issue,\" straubel says. \"we felt it was most relevant to respond to the piece that's the real risk.\". straubel credits keenlabs' researchers for kickstarting tesla's move to push out its code signing upgrade. he says tesla will pay keenlabs' team a monetary reward for its work as part of company's bug bounty program. \"they did good work,\" straubel says. \"they helped us find something that's a problem we needed to fix. and that's what we did.\". and if the rest of the auto industry is paying attention, they might take the lesson of that chinese hack to heart, too.",

        "body": "tesla's autopilot 8.0 protects kids and pets left in hot cars.. tesla model x (tesla). one of the most important upgrades is the addition of a temperature-control function developed to save the lives of pets and infants trapped in a hot car. the feature automatically turns the air conditioning on if it senses that the temperature in the cockpit rises above 105 degrees fahrenheit, and if the battery pack has at least a 20-percent charge. the temperature-control function is always on, but owners shouldn't be concerned about compromising driving range by draining the battery pack, according to tesla co-founder and ceo elon musk. the executive wrote on twitter that temperature control can run for up to a year if the battery is full, meaning it uses only a tiny amount of electricity. read more: elon musk says apple missed an opportunity by not building a car sooner. tesla's efforts to protect kids and pets comes shortly after members of the united states house of representatives introduced a bill called the helping overcome trauma for children alone in rear seats act of 2016, or hot cars. the legislation is a little vague, but it aims to ensure that \"all new passenger motor vehicles be equipped with technology to provide an alert that a child or unattended passenger remains in a rear seating position after the vehicle motor is deactivated.\". some of the other improvements inaugurated by autopilot 8.0 were detailed recently by tesla. as previously reported, the software now uses a radar, not a camera, to generate a view of the outside world. the radar can bounce under a vehicle to see what's in front of it, so \"the car should almost always hit the brakes correctly even if a ufo were to land on the freeway in zero-visibility conditions,\" according to a statement published by the company. version 8.0 also allows the model s and the model x to autonomously take freeway exits. tesla began sending out autopilot 8.0 last night as an over-the-air software update. don't worry if your car doesn't have it yet; musk explained on twitter that the \"release will be gradual to make sure there aren't small regressions.\" he added that autopilot 8.0 has to work on many different cars operating in drastically different environments.",

        "body": "tesla says it's improving autopilot by boosting radar.. sunday's news comes in the wake of a may crash involving a tesla model s that was using the semi-autonomous mode at the time. the driver died after crashing into a tractor-trailer. on a conference call with reporters, musk said he thinks that the improvements, which will roll out globally in the next week or two in the form of a software update, probably would have prevented that crash. the national highway traffic safety administration, which is investigating the crash, said sunday that tesla has provided it with information about the changes to autopilot, which it will review. it declined to provide an update on its tesla investigation. musk called the upgrades a \"massive enhancement,\" but he said that tesla cars are already the safest on the road. \"it's not about going from bad to good,\" musk said on the call. \"things are already good. i think it's about going from good to great.\". while he acknowledged that there's no such thing as perfect security, he predicted that the improvements will cut the accident rate for tesla vehicles by more than half. tesla's autopilot system can maintain a set speed, keep the car within its lane and brake automatically. radar, which was added to all tesla vehicles starting in october 2014, currently helps the car see things that may be blocked to cameras in bright sunlight or bad weather. the improvements announced sunday call for autopilot to rely more on radar and less on vehicle cameras. as part of that shift, the radar will use more advanced signal processing to create a better picture of the surrounding world. musk said that he has wanted to make these kinds of improvements to autopilot since last year, but he was told it couldn't be done for various technical reasons. \"we really pushed hard on questioning all of those assumptions over the past few months,\" he said. \"it was just a very hard problem. nobody else could solve this.\". according to tesla, one of the biggest challenges was the need to eliminate false positives. while slamming on the brakes is crucial if a driver is about to hit another vehicle, it isn't if they're about to hit something smaller, like garbage in the road. and these kinds of stops always have the potential to cause injury, making a false positive potentially dangerous. but musk said the company was eventually able to solve that problem through software improvements. he added that he expects the radar system to continue to improve over the next several months, as the company collects more data and makes changes.",
