"ohio auto dealers fight tesla over sales model. a new tesla all electric car is on display, monday, march 17, 2014, at a tesla showroom inside the kenwood towne centre in cincinnati. ohio auto dealers are sparring at the statehouse with the california-based tesla, which is selling it next generation electric cars from three ohio storefronts. lawmakers in ohio and other states are trying to block tesla direct sales on grounds they undercut traditional auto dealerships ohio is among states proposing to block tesla from setting up additional direct-sales galleries on grounds they undercut traditional auto dealerships. last tuesday, new jersey officials approved a regulation effectively prohibiting automakers from going straight to customers. tesla vice president diarmuid o onnell visited ohio legislative leaders that same day to try to discourage them from passing similar restrictions. the bill would shut down our ability to grow in the ohio market and, frankly, it just a first step to them shutting down our existing businesses, o onnell said. this is the pattern we see in other states the administration of republican gov. john kasich, through the bureau of motor vehicles, issued a license to tesla authorizing the company to open its own stores in cincinnati and columbus. joe cannon, a lobbyist for the ohio automobile dealers association, told lawmakers in testimony last week that the decision means ohio longstanding licensing rules have been thrown upside down the association filed unsuccessful legal action against tesla two existing ohio stores, so now is fighting for passage of a bill that would prevent tesla from expanding to other locations. ohio dealers - with 830 dealerships, 50,000 employees and $2 billion in payroll annually - say their businesses can only prosper when the law separates manufacturers and dealers. they view the license ohio granted to tesla as opening a pandora box. the bmv decision opens the door for all manufacturers - both emerging and existing - to follow the same path, cannon told the senate finance committee. this decision has serious implications for both our dealers and consumers. from an industry perspective, our members have made substantial investments in their businesses, employees and communities across the state o onnell argues the several hundred vehicles tesla has sold in ohio represent a fraction of the market, which averages about 500,000 cars annually. the decade-old car company is based in palo alto, calif., and sells two models - the two-seat sports-style roadster, at about $100,000; and the model s sedan, at about $75,000. it would like to eventually offer a $35,000 economy model, he said. o onnell said the cars can be difficult to sell so direct-sales are needed to jumpstart electric-car technology and drive down prices. he said many dealers refuse to sell tesla cars yet their associations are fighting to limit the company ability to sell them itself across the country, including in ohio, georgia and new york. at what it calls galleries operated in maryland, arizona, texas and virginia, consumers can view vehicles but aren able to discuss price, take test drives or place orders. an arizona lawmaker has introduced legislation that would overturn a sales restriction in place there. o onnell said no u.s. auto manufacturer with an existing franchise dealership has ever sought to follow such a direct-sales model so threats from auto dealers are specious. the dealers are simply flexing their muscles, exerting their power to lock down the market and create a de jure monopoly, he said. cannon argued to ohio senators that dealerships play an important watchdog role that is lost through direct sales. dealers act as advocates for their customers as it relates to warranty, recall and other service-related issues with the manufacturer, he said. the distinctly different roles of dealers and manufacturers act as a system of checks and balances to ensure that warranty and other service issues are administered fairly ",0
"sec calls musk first amendment tweet defense ridiculous . u.s. securities regulators countered tesla ceo elon musk contempt-of-court defense monday night, writing in court papers that he brazenly disregarded a federal judge order and that one of his arguments borders on the ridiculous lawyers for the securities and exchange commission, in a response to musk, wrote that when the contempt motion was filed in february, musk had not had a single tweet approved by a company lawyer, violating a requirement of a court-approved settlement order. the october securities fraud settlement stemmed from tweets by musk in august about having the money to take tesla private at $420 per share. but musk didn have the funding secured. tesla and musk each had to pay $20 million in fines and agree to governance changes that included musk removal as chairman. sec lawyers led by cheryl crumpton wrote in a response to musk defense that he interprets the settlement order as not requiring pre-approval unless musk decides the tweets are meaningful to investors. the agency said musk argument that tweeting about car production forecasts on feb. 19 wasn material information is nearly ridiculous. his interpretation is inconsistent with the plain terms of this court order and renders its pre-approval requirement meaningless, the lawyers wrote. u.s. district judge alison nathan in manhattan will decide if musk is in contempt and whether he should be punished. the sec said no hearing is necessary on the matter because there appear to be no disputed issues of material fact musk lawyers wrote last week that the feb. 19 tweet merely restated previously approved disclosures on electric car production volumes. they wrote that the tweet, which was published after the markets closed, neither revealed material information, nor altered the mix of data available to investors. the lawyers also accused the securities and exchange commission of censorship and of violating musk first amendment rights by imposing a prior restraint on his speech. but the sec lawyers wrote that submitting statements for approval does not mean musk is prohibited from speaking. as long as a statement submitted for pre-approval is not false or misleading, tesla would presumably approve its publication without prior restraint on musk, they wrote. the sec also wrote that musk waived any first amendment challenge to the order when he agreed to it. musk lawyers also argued that the sec motion for contempt is an over-reach that exceeds its authority. but the sec said enforcement of the order is up to the judge, who has broad powers to enforce court orders. monday filing said the feb. 19 tweet was different from prior public disclosures by the company. also, musk has regularly published tweets with substantive information about the company and its business, the sec contended. musk 13-word feb. 19 tweet said that tesla would produce around 500,000 vehicles this year, but it wasn approved by the company disclosure counsel, the sec has said. the lawyer quickly realized it and summoned musk to the company fremont, california, factory to help write a correction. the company would make vehicles at a rate of 500,000 per year, but it wouldn produce a half-million in 2019. musk response by former enron prosecutor john c. hueston of newport beach, california, said that the settlement allows musk reasonable discretion to determine if his communications would require the lawyer approval. in the case of the feb. 19 tweet, musk determined that it did not. legal experts say it unlikely that musk will be punished severely, but the commission wants to get on the record that musk violated the terms, to prepare for any future violations. the tweet was posted and corrected after u.s. markets had closed, but experts say regulators don care much about that because stocks are traded nearly around the clock. tesla stock rose by just $1.10, or less than 1 percent, the next day.",2
"tesla unveils updated electric luxury sedan the new car is an alpha test version of the model s, which the company says will undergo testing in a variety of climates and be used to refine the 5-door vehicle driving dynamics in the real world. it will be followed by a beta test version prior to the start of production at tesla assembly plant in fremont, california. the alpha features crisper lines and what appear to be additional cooling inlets in the front fascia compared to the original concept car. the overall design carries with it much of the same flavor found in the current jaguar xf and kia optima sedans, its swoopy roofline concealing the fact that it is a 7-passenger vehicle with room for two rear-facing jump seats under the hatch. the car will likely undergo further visual changes before it goes on sale next year. with a projected price of $57,400 tesla claims that the base model s will have a 160 mile range, sports sedan-like acceleration and the ability to be recharged in 45 minutes when plugged into a fast-charging station. versions with ranges of 230 and 300 miles will also be available for $67,400 and $87,400, respectively, reflecting the high-price of battery technology. updated interior photos have yet to be revealed, but the centerpiece of the concept car is a vertically-oriented 17-inch g3-enabled touchscreen entertainment system. tesla expects produce 5,000 units of the model s in 2012, ramping that up to 20,000 in 2013, when it also plans to introduce a crossover built on the same platform, currently known as the model x.",0
"elon musk says tesla cybertruck update probably coming soon. a cybertruck sneak peek is on the way. tesla ceo elon musk tweeted over the weekend that he expects to offer the next update on the upcoming electric pickup in the second quarter of this year. musk revealed in february that he had just seen the final design of the truck, which has apparently evolved from the prototype revealed in november 2019. he had previously said that tesla was aiming to make the final design an improvement over the show truck, which he has been seen driving around the los angeles area. musk added in the most recent tweet that the company focus is on completing the austin, tex., factory where the cybertruck will be built using a uniquely developed method to manufacture its stainless steel body. his comments come as tesla stock price has fallen from an all-time high close of 883.09 on january 26 to 597.95 on march 5 amid a broader drop in tech stocks and increasing competition in the electric car segment. during the company last earnings call, musk said he hoped to see a few cybertrucks come off of the assembly line before the end of this year, but that full production won begin before 2022. tesla has said that it has over 200,000 reservations for the pickup, which will have a starting price of $49,900 when it goes on sale this year, according to tesla reservation website, and a $39,900 model is slated to be added to teh lineup in late 2022.",1
"tesla cancels full self-driving expansion ahead of major update. tesla has canceled a planned expansion of its full self-driving beta software test ahead of a major update reportedly launching in april approximately 2,000 tesla owners have been given early access to the expanded functionality, which allows a vehicle to control itself on city streets with human supervision and is listed as version 8.2 of the software. in early march, tesla ceo elon musk said that a download button for version 8.3 would soon appear on the displays in certain cars, but he has apparently confirmed on twitter that the company will be skipping the upgrade in lieu of a version 9.0 coming in april. musk last week said that the upgrade would eliminate the need for the system to use radar and would rely solely on the eight cameras the cars are equipped with and artificial intelligence. most other automakers and technology companies developing autonomous driving systems use a combination of radar, camera and lidar sensors, the last of which tesla has called a fool errand anyone relying on lidar is doomed. doomed!, musk said during tesla autonomy day in 2019. it like having a whole bunch of expensive appendices. like, one appendix is bad, well now you have a whole bunch of them, it ridiculous, you l see various videos posted to social media by beta testers show very different sides of the full self-driving capability, with it operating almost flawlessly in some and making major mistakes in others. tesla electronic driver aids have come under increased scrutiny from the national highway traffic safety administration following numerous accidents that are being investigated to see if the autopilot or full self-driving systems were involved. last week, musk confirmed that several tesla owners had been removed from the beta test because it had been determined via an internal camera that they weren paying proper attention when using the full self-driving system.",2
"nj bans tesla from selling cars directly to consumers. $57,400 electric sedan goes on sale in summer 2012. the state motor vehicle commission voted tuesday to ban automakers from selling cars directly to consumers, instead requiring them to work through franchised dealers, a rule supported by the new jersey coalition of automotive retailers . tesla now has until april 1st to cease sales operations at the two showrooms the company operates in the state, according to bloomberg. prior to the vote, tesla ceo elon musk accused new jersey governor chris christie administration of reneging on an agreement to delay any changes to the regulations until the topic could be taken up by the state legislature, rather than a rulemaking body. but a christie spokesperson put the onus on musk, telling automotive news that since tesla first began operating in new jersey one year ago, it was made clear that the company would need to engage the legislature on a bill to establish their new direct-sales operations under new jersey law if the rule goes into effect as planned, new jersey will become the fifth state to ban tesla direct sales model, while several others are considering following suit. in such states, the company galleries are not only restricted from selling the cars themselves, but also from giving out information on how to purchase them. the commission added requirements that dealerships maintain showrooms of no less than 1,000 square feet, with room to display at least two vehicles and have service centers attached. tesla showrooms, such as the one in new jersey short hills mall, are typically separate from the company centralized service centers. musk called the process an affront to the very concept of a free market, while njcar president james appleton, told bloomberg that the statute is on the books to protect consumers, he said, while tesla business model crushes competition test drive: tesla model s p85.",0
"tesla hepa air filter hundreds of times more effective than standard units . the filtering system is so clean that tesla claims you could survive a military grade bio attack using it. hepa, an acronym for high-efficiency particulate arrestance , means that the filter is capable of capturing 99.7 percent of particles 0.3 micrometers and larger. tesla says its hepa filter was inspired by the kind used in hospitals and in aerospace applications, and that the system is hundreds of times more effective than standard cabin air filters used in other vehicles. the hepa filter is part of tesla bioweapon defense mode, a term generally considered tongue-in-cheek until a recent test in which a model x was placed in a sealed bubble filled with air containing 83 times as many particles as the epa considers to be good air quality. with the bioweapon defense mode switched on, the model x hepa filter cleared the pollution to levels tesla says were entirely undetectable by instruments. moreover, tesla says the model x actually began cleaning the air outside the car because of how effective its filter was at sucking in pollution.",1
"ntsb report says california tesla driver was using autopilot when he hit a firetruck. a government report says the driver of a tesla that slammed into a firetruck near los angeles last year was using the car autopilot system when a vehicle in front of him suddenly changed lanes and he didn have time to react the national transportation safety board said tuesday the driver never saw the parked firetruck and didn brake. apparently the man 2014 tesla model s didn brake either. the report raises further questions about the effectiveness of tesla system, which was in operation before several other crashes including two fatalities in florida and one in silicon valley. tesla warns drivers that the system is not fully autonomous and drivers must be ready to intervene. the ntsb report didn state a cause of the crash. the agency will issue a final report wednesday. click here for the fox news app. the driver in the jan. 22, 2018 firetruck crash on interstate 405 was not hurt. but the ntsb report says he did not have his hands on the steering wheel at the time of the crash. the firetruck from culver city, california, had stopped in the northbound high occupancy vehicle lane with its emergency lights flashing as it responded to another crash. the firefighters were also uninjured. the tesla driver, from suburban woodland hills, told the ntsb that he was traveling to work in los angeles when the crash happened. he told investigators he was looking forward with his hand rested on his knee while touching the bottom of the steering wheel. just before the crash, a large vehicle, an suv or pickup truck, changed lanes in front of him, the driver told the ntsb. although the driver stated that he was looking forward, he was unable to see the firetruck in time enough to avoid the crash. the driver had coffee and a bagel at the time, but he wasn sure if either was in his hand when the crash occurred, according to the report. cellphone data showed the driver was not using his phone to talk or text in the minutes leading up to the crash. a statement from a driver in a nearby vehicle provided by tesla said the driver appeared to be looking down at a cellphone or other device he was holding in his left hand before the crash. the ntsb determined in september 2017 that design limitations of the tesla model s autopilot played a major role in a may 2016 fatal crash in florida involving a vehicle operating under autopilot. but it blamed the crash on an inattentive tesla driver overreliance on technology and a truck driver who made a left turn in front of the car. the california investigation comes as the federal government has few regulations governing autonomous vehicles and driver-assist systems that can drive a car under certain circumstances. the systems can significantly reduce crashes, but computer-driven vehicles also can make mistakes.",0

with its roof sheared off completely - had come to rest in a nearby yard hundreds of feet from the crash site, assistant chief danny wallace of the williston fire department told the associated press. the driver was pronounced dead, signal 7 in the local firefighters jargon, and they respectfully covered the wreckage and waited for crash investigators to arrive. the company said this was the first known death in over 130 million miles of autopilot operation. it said the nhtsa investigation is a preliminary inquiry to determine whether the system worked as expected. tesla says that before autopilot can be used, drivers have to acknowledge that the system is an assist feature that requires a driver to keep both hands on the wheel at all times. drivers are told they need to maintain control and responsibility for your vehicle while using the system, and they have to be prepared to take over at any time, the statement said. autopilot makes frequent checks, making sure the driver hands are on the wheel, and it gives visual and audible alerts if hands aren detected, and it gradually slows the car until a driver responds, the statement said. the autopilot mode allows the model s sedan and model x suv to steer itself within a lane, change lanes and speed up or slow down based on surrounding traffic or the driver set speed. it can automatically apply brakes and slow the vehicle. it can also scan for parking spaces and parallel park on command. tesla conceded that the autopilot feature is not perfect, but said in the statement that it getting better all the time. when used in conjunction with driver oversight, the data is unequivocal that autopilot reduces driver workload and results in a statistically significant improvement in safety, the company said. nhtsa office of defects is handling the investigation. the opening of the preliminary evaluation shouldn be construed as a finding that the government believes the model s is defective, nhtsa said in a statement. the tesla death comes as nhtsa is taking steps to ease the way onto the nation roads for self-driving cars, an anticipated sea-change in driving where tesla has been on the leading edge. self-driving cars have been expected to be a boon to safety because they l eliminate human errors. human error is responsible for about 94 percent of crashes. musk has been bullish about autopilot, even as tesla warns owners the feature is not for all conditions and not sophisticated enough for the driver to check out. this spring, musk said the feature reduced the probability of having an accident by 50 percent, without detailing his calculations. in january, he said that autopilot is probably better than a person right now one of tesla advantages over competitors is that its thousands of cars feed real-world performance information back to the company, which can then fine-tune the software that runs autopilot. this is not the first time automatic braking systems have malfunctioned, and several have been recalled to fix problems. in november, for instance, toyota had to recall 31,000 full-sized lexus and toyota cars because the automatic braking system radar mistook steel joints or plates in the road for an object ahead of the car and put on the brakes. the technology relies on multiple cameras, radar, laser and computers to sense objects and determine if they are in the car way, said mike harley, an analyst at kelley blue book. systems like tesla , which rely heavily on cameras, aren sophisticated enough to overcome blindness from bright or low contrast light, he said. harley called the death unfortunate and said more deaths can be expected as the autonomous technology is refined. shares of tesla motors inc. fell $6.77, or 3.2 percent, in after-hours trading after news of the crash was released. during the trading day, the stock was up 1 percent at $212.28. karl brauer, a senior analyst with kelley blue book, said the accident is a huge blow to tesla reputation. they have been touting their safety and they have been touting their advanced technology, he said. this situation flies in the face of both brauer said tesla will have to repair the damage in two ways. first, the company needs to make sure its customers understand that autopilot is meant to assist drivers, not to fully take over for them. second, the company should update the cars software so autopilot will turn off if it senses the driver hands aren on the wheel for a certain period of time. mercedes-benz driver assist system is among those that require drivers hands to be on the wheel.",0

"tesla, bmw electrics fall short of highest crash-test rating. the insurance institute for highway safety tested 2017 models of both vehicles. neither earned the institute top safety pick award, which is given to vehicles that get the highest rating in five different crash tests and offer a crash-prevention system with automatic braking. to get a highest top safety pick-plus designation, vehicles must meet all of those criteria and have good headlights. in the 2017 model year, 38 vehicles have won the top safety pick-plus designation, including two plug-in hybrids: the toyota prius prime and the chevrolet volt. but no all-electric vehicles are on the list. the institute hasn yet tested the all-electric chevrolet bolt, which went on sale at the end of 2016. tesla model s, an all-electric luxury sedan that starts at $72,500, earned good ratings in four of the institute five tests, including a side impact test and a head restraint test. but it earned a lower rating in a small overlap frontal crash test, which replicates what happens when the front corner of the car collides with a tree or telephone poll at 40 miles per hour. the tesla safety belt allowed the crash dummy to move too far forward and it hit its head on the steering wheel. the institute said tesla made a production change this month to address the problem, so the car will be tested again. the model s has earned the highest ratings on u.s. government crash tests, but iihs performs different tests. tesla also earned a poor rating for its headlights. and a high-performance version of the model s, the p100d, got a lower ranking on the roof strength test because its larger battery makes it much heavier, so the roof might not hold up as well in a rollover crash. the government hasn performed a roof-strength test on the p100d. the bmw i3, a small electric car that starts at $42,400, also earned good ratings in four out of five tests. it fell short in the head restraint test, which measures how well the car protects against neck injuries in a rear crash. the i3 earned the second-highest rating of acceptable for its headlights. the government hasn yet reported crash-test results for the i3.",2

"ntsb: tesla autopilot was engaged before fatal florida crash. a tesla model 3 involved in a fatal crash with a semitrailer in florida march 1 was operating on the company semi-autonomous autopilot system, federal investigators have determined. the car drove beneath the trailer, killing the driver, in a crash that is strikingly similar to one that happened on the other side of florida in 2016 that also involved use of autopilot in both cases, neither the driver nor the autopilot system stopped for the trailers, and the roofs of the cars were sheared off. the delray beach crash, which remains under investigation by the national transportation safety board and the national highway traffic safety administration, raises questions about the effectiveness of autopilot, which uses cameras, long-range radar and computers to detect objects in front of the cars to avoid collisions. the system also can keep a car in its lane, change lanes and navigate freeway interchanges. tesla has maintained that the system is designed only to assist drivers, who must pay attention at all times and be ready to intervene. in a preliminary report on the march 1 crash, the ntsb said that initial data and video from the tesla show that the driver turned on autopilot about 10 seconds before the crash on a divided highway with turn lanes in the median. from less than eight seconds until the time of the crash, the driver hands were not detected on the steering wheel, the ntsb report stated. tesla model 3 test drive. neither the data nor the videos indicated the driver or the autopilot system braked or tried to avoid the trailer, the report stated. the model 3 was going 68 miles per hour when it hit the trailer on u.s. 441, and the speed limit was 55 mph, the report said. jeremy beren banner, 50, was killed. tesla said in a statement thursday that banner did not use autopilot at any other time during the drive before the crash. vehicle logs show that he took his hands off the steering wheel immediately after activating autopilot, the statement said. tesla also said it saddened by the crash and that drivers have traveled more than 1 billion miles while using autopilot. when used properly by an attentive driver who is prepared to take control at all times, drivers supported by autopilot are safer than those operating without assistance, the company said. porn shot in tesla on autopilot:. the circumstances of the delray beach crash are much like one that occurred in may 2016 near gainesville, florida. joshua brown, 40, of canton, ohio, was traveling in a tesla model s on a divided highway and using the autopilot system when he was killed. neither brown nor the car braked for a tractor-trailer, which had turned left in front of the tesla and was crossing its path. brown tesla also went beneath the trailer and its roof was sheared off. after that crash tesla ceo elon musk said the company made changes in its system so radar would play more of a role in detecting objects. david friedman, who was acting head of nhtsa in 2014 and is now vice president of advocacy for consumer reports, said he was surprised the agency didn declare autopilot defective after the gainesville crash and seek a recall. the delray beach crash, he said, reinforces that autopilot is being allowed to operate in situations it cannot handle safely. their system cannot literally see the broad side of an 18-wheeler on the highway, friedman said. tesla system was too slow to warn the driver to pay attention, unlike systems that consumer reports has tested from general motors and other companies, friedman said. gm super cruise driver assist system only operates on divided highways with no median turn lanes, he said. tesla needs a better system to more quickly detect whether drivers are paying attention and warn them if they are not, friedman said, adding that some owners tend to rely on the system too much. tesla has for too long been using human drivers as guinea pigs. this is tragically what happens, he said. to force a recall, nhtsa must do an investigation and show that the way a vehicle is designed is outside of industry standards. there are multiple systems out on the roads right now that take over some level of steering and speed control, but there only one of them that we keep hearing about where people are dying or getting into crashes. that kind of stands out, friedman said. nhtsa said thursday that its investigation is continuing and its findings will be made public when it completed. the delray beach crash casts doubt on musk statement that tesla will have fully self-driving vehicles on the roads sometime next year. musk said last month that tesla had developed a powerful computer that could use artificial intelligence to safely navigate the roads with the same camera and radar sensors that are now on tesla cars. show me the data, friedman said. tesla is long on big claims and short on proof. they e literally showing how not to do it by rushing technology out in a 2017 report on the gainesville crash, the ntsb wrote that design limitations of autopilot played a major role. the agency said that tesla told model s owners that autopilot should be used only on limited-access highways, primarily interstates. the report said that despite upgrades to the system, tesla did not incorporate protections against use of the system on other types of roads. the ntsb found that the model s cameras and radar weren capable of detecting a vehicle turning into its path. rather, the systems are designed to detect vehicles they are following to prevent rear-end collisions.",2

"ntsb investigating tesla crash allegedly involving autopilot a tesla rear-ended a fire truck parked to respond to an accident on i-405 in culver city, calif. on jan. 22, 2018, according to the culver city fire department and california highway patrol the u.s. government has sent two investigators to collect evidence from an an accident involving a tesla model s that was allegedy operating in its autopilot mode when it crashed into the back of a parked fire truck on monday in culver city, california. the national transportation safety board said on twitter that the team will be focusing on driver and vehicle factors. the accident took place in broad daylight on interstate 405 when the tesla rear-ended the fire truck, which was responding to a previous incident. witnesses estimate that the car was traveling at 65 mph at the time of the collision and that the driver said autopilot was activated. this is the second time the ntsb has looked into a crash involving tesla autopilot feature, which is a driver assist system with limited semi-autonomous capabilities. the ntsb in september determined that design limitations of the tesla model s autopilot played a major role in a may 2016 fatal crash in florida involving a vehicle operating under autopilot. but it blamed the crash on an inattentive tesla driver overreliance on technology and a truck driver who made a left turn in front of the car. the california investigation comes as congress and federal agencies grapple with how to regulate autonomous vehicles and those with systems that are partially self-driving. the systems can significantly reduce crashes, but computer-driven vehicles also can make mistakes. tesla wouldn say if autopilot was working at the time of the culver city crash, but said in a statement monday that drivers must stay attentive when it in use. the company would not comment on the investigation. in monday crash, the california highway patrol and the culver city fire department confirmed the southbound tesla hit the rear of the firetruck but could not confirm if autopilot was operating, the mercury news of san jose reported. the firetruck was parked in the left emergency and carpool lane with emergency lights flashing to block a previous crash on monday morning, culver city fire battalion chief ken powell told the newspaper. the tesla suffered significant damage, but the driver showed no significant injuries, powell said. the model s autopilot is a level 2 on a self-driving scale of 0 to 5. level 5 vehicles can operate autonomously in nearly all circumstances. level 2 automation systems are generally limited to use on interstate highways, which don have intersections. autopilot keeps a vehicle centered in its lane at a set distance from cars in front of it. it also can change lanes and brake automatically. drivers are supposed to continuously monitor vehicle performance and be ready to take control if necessary. in the florida crash, which killed an ohio man driving the tesla, ntsb investigators found that the sedan cameras and radar weren capable of detecting a vehicle turning into its path. rather, the systems are designed to detect vehicles being followed to prevent rear-end collisions. the ntsb re-issued previous recommendations that the government require all new cars and trucks to be equipped with technology that wirelessly transmits the vehicles location, speed, heading and other information to other vehicles in order to prevent collisions the ntsb also recommended that automakers develop systems to make sure drivers pay attention while using semi-autonomous systems, other than detecting the pressure of hands on the steering wheel. the driver in the florida crash had his hands on the sedan steering wheel for only 25 seconds out of the 37.5 minutes the vehicle cruise control and lane-keeping systems were in use prior to the crash, investigators found. tesla has taken steps to prevent drivers from using autopilot improperly, including measuring the amount of torque applied to the steering wheel and sending visual and audio warnings. if the warnings are ignored, drivers would be prevented from using autopilot, the company has said. the national highway traffic safety administration, which regulates auto safety, declined last year to issue a recall or fine tesla as a result of the crash, but it warned automakers they aren to treat semi-autonomous cars as if they were fully self-driving. the associated press contributed to this report.",2
"court gives elon musk, sec two weeks to settle tweet dispute a judge on thursday urged stock market regulators and tesla ceo elon musk to amicably settle their dispute over his tweets. if not, she said she l decide whether to grant regulators request that the outspoken executive face escalating fines if he breaks rules protecting investors. u.s. district judge alison j. nathan asked how she should punish musk if she finds him in contempt for violating a deal with the securities and exchange commission requiring him to first clear with lawyers tweets that might disclose important company facts. sec attorney cheryl crumpton recommended fines. but at the end of the hearing, nathan ordered both sides to seek a resolution over the next two weeks. everybody take a deep breath, put your reasonableness pants on and work this out, nathan said. even so, nathan said court-supervised agreements must be obeyed. i don care if you are a small potato or a big fish, nathan said as musk, with an estimated worth of $22 billion, sat at a defense table with his lawyers. nathan pressed crumpton during the hearing to define the conditions under which musk should seek approval before he tweets, and drew attention to ambiguity surrounding the rules the sec sought to enforce. musk, who followed the back-and-forth intently with a slight frown and furrowed brow, emerged from the courtroom to say: i very happy with the result and i impressed with judge nathan analysis legal experts said it makes sense for the two sides to negotiate another settlement rather than to leave the decision to nathan, although they cautioned it always difficult to predict what the famously mercurial musk will do. the big question is whether he will dig in his heels and resist, said peter henning, a wayne state university law professor and former sec attorney. i get the feeling they will come up with something because musk probably doesn want to risk being held in contempt of court. that will be like two strikes against him attorney john hueston, representing musk, told the judge the sec had failed to show his client had violated the deal. he said his client was somebody trying his best to comply he actually does what he is told, hueston said. in a statement after the hearing, musk signaled he is willing to work out a deal with regulators. we have always felt that we should be able to work through any disagreements directly with the sec, rather than prematurely rushing to court, he said. the issue over musk tweets stems from a settlement reached last year after musk tweeted that he had secured the funding to take tesla private at $420 a share - a substantial premium over the price at the time - when he did not. that tweet, last august, sent the company stock on a wild ride. the sec says it hurt investors who bought tesla stock after the tweet but before they had accurate information. musk later backed off the idea of taking the company private, but regulators concluded he had not lined up the money to pull off the deal. the sec says musk blatantly violated the settlement in february when he tweeted about tesla vehicle production without a lawyer approval. musk 13-word tweet on feb. 19 said tesla would produce around 500,000 vehicles this year. but the tweet wasn approved by tesla disclosure counsel, and the sec contempt-of-court motion filed that month said musk had not sought a lawyer approval for a single tweet. musk said his tweet about car production didn need pre-approval because it wasn new information that would be meaningful to investors. his attorneys said the sec was violating his first amendment rights to free speech. much of the debate thursday centered around whether the sec rules provide a clear way to for musk to determine whether or not the information he about to tweet would be material to investors and, therefore, require preapproval from lawyers. this case is like a shot across the bow from the sec, said marc leaf, a new york lawyer who formerly worked for the agency and advised on its settlement agreements. what they would like tesla board to do is tell elon, you are a genius but your tweets aren the smartest thing to be doing, so cut it out but hueston argued further restricting musk ability to communicate about his company and imposing fines would freeze his ability to operate as an effective entrepreneur. to support his arguments, hueston cited an earlier exchange between the judge and crumpton in which nathan said she was surprised that the sec left it up to musk in so many instances whether to run by his lawyers what he intended to put out publicly. does he need preapproval? the judge asked crumpton at one point. we e not saying yes or no, she responded. hueston said the sec first step after the tweet about production should have been to approach tesla in good faith, and nathan agreed. the parties should be meeting, conferring and providing some clarity so this issue won happen again, hueston said. the sec says its deal doesn restrict musk freedom of speech because as long as his statements are not false or misleading, they would be approved. meanwhile, tesla shares fell 8% thursday after the company disclosed that both its car manufacturing pace and vehicle delivery rate slowed during the first three months of the year, raising questions about its ability to be consistently profitable. the sec sought to oust musk from his role as chairman and ceo over his august tweet. instead, musk and tesla agreed to pay $40 million and made other concessions to settle the case and ensure musk remained ceo. musk unpredictable behavior has led some to question whether he should remain in that job, while others say he a visionary too valuable to lose. last year, musk berated stock market analysts for asking questions about tesla finances and prompted a defamation lawsuit when he called a diver who helped rescue 12 boys on a thai soccer team from a flooded cave a pedophile.",0
"watching a tesla tech pull a kitten out of a bumper will warm your heart. before you send elon musk a tweet, you should know that tesla does not build a version of the model x with a one-catpower drivetrain. it is not another one of the company clever easter eggs, either. as it turns out, a kitten found its way behind the rear bumper and couldn find its way out. the owner couldn remove the bumper on his own, so he drove to the nearest service center and asked for help. we would love to read the repair order; customer states car makes cat-like noises. a technician confirmed the presence of a small, furry, and presumably terrified creature trapped in the back of the car. extracting it required putting the model x on a lift and unbolting the rear underbody panel, which tesla installs on all of its models to make them more aerodynamic and, consequently, more efficient. an opening in the plastic part gave the kitten its first sight of daylight in about 14 hours, but it was too scared to jump out on its own. wearing thick gloves, the technician had to reach in the car belly and pull the kitten out. the entire operation took less than a minute. there is no word on exactly how the kitten wound up behind the bumper of a tesla x. anyone who has ever owned a cat willtestify that they are crafty and flexible, so anything is possible. regardless, this story has a happy ending: one of the technicians working at the service center immediately decided to give the cat a new home.",1
"tesla model 3 arrives friday, two weeks ahead of schedule for those keeping track, that a couple of weeks sooner than expected--which is highly unusual, given tesla history of production delays. musk shared the good news on twitter, as one does these days:. he went on to say that there would be a handover party for the first 30 vehicles on july 28 and that by december, the company would likely be producing about 20,000 of the all-electric sedans per month. that good news for tesla fans and the company investors. though it been months since tesla released figures on how many model s vehicles have been reserved, the number appears to rest somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000. even if only half of the people who put down $1,000 to get one of the new cars follow-through with their purchases, that huge demand for tesla to meet--especially considering that tesla only built around 84,000 vehicles during the entire 2016 calendar year. how is tesla achieving that feat?. for starters, production of the model 3 is largely automated--certainly more automated than production of the model s and model x. obviously, that allows tesla to turn out more vehicles faster. also, as musk said early last month during a conference call with investors, buyers currently have only two customization options with the model 3: color and wheels. over time, the range of options will broaden, no doubt, but by keeping variations to a minimum, manufacturing can be sped up. model 3 can currently be ordered in about 100 different configurations, while the model s has closer to 1,500. the model 3 is expected to be a game-changer in the electric car field. starting at $35,000, it tesla first model with a mass-market pricetag. demand is expected to grow, and the company plans to produce 500,000 model 3s next year. in gearing up for the model 3 arrival, tesla has begun laying the groundwork to keep future owners happy. it adding service centers, mobile repair units, and its first-ever body repair shops. for more on this story, visit our colleagues at green car reports. this article orignally appeared on the car connection.",1
"tesla pays off government loan nine years early. file - in this june 22, 2012 file photo, tesla workers cheer on the first tesla model s cars sold during a rally at the tesla factory in fremont, calif. the tesla motors inc. model s electric car has tied an older lexus for the highest score ever recorded in consumer reports magazine automotive testing on thursday, may 9, 2013 the palo alto, calif., company said it wired in a $451.8 million payment to the government on wednesday. the money, coupled with two prior payments, paid off a $465 million loan tesla got from the department of energy loan in 2010 to foster development of advanced-technology vehicles. tesla used money from a $968 million stock and note sale that closed wednesday to repay the debt. the repayment is good for tesla image because the company no longer owes taxpayers money. and the government quickly touted the payment as an example of a success from an energy department loan program used to start clean-energy companies. the $34 billion loan portfolio has seen several high-profile defaults, including solar panel maker solyndra, plus a potential default by electric car maker fisker automotive. but the energy department said in a statement that losses to date amount to 2 percent of the portfolio, or about $680 million. the department said it has helped to start 19 new clean-energy power plants that have added enough solar, wind and geothermal generating capacity to power a million homes. when you e talking about cutting-edge clean-energy technologies, not every investment will succeed, energy secretary ernest moniz said. tesla sells only one car, the $70,000 model s, which the company says can travel up to 300 miles on a charge at 55 mph. earlier this month, tesla reported its first quarterly profit. its stock price has more than doubled since the first of the year and closed wednesday at $87.24. also in may, consumer reports magazine said the model s tied for the highest rating in the history of the magazine auto testing. industry analysts say the success of the debt and stock offerings give the company working capital for the future and are a strong indicator of the market confidence in the company, led by paypal billionaire and spacex founder elon musk. the payment helps tesla show its independence, said dougherty & co. analyst andrea james. it allows them to say, we e not dependent on low-interest financing from the government, she said. it also lets musk thumb his nose at critics like republican presidential candidate mitt romney, who in the first presidential debate accused president barack obama of picking losers for putting money into tesla and fisker. tesla motors inc. is among five auto companies that got loans from the energy department to develop clean vehicles, including fisker, ford motor co., nissan motor co. and the vehicle production group llc. ford got a $5.9 billion loan, while nissan got $1.45 billion. the government is in danger of losing $171 million at fisker, which may soon seek bankruptcy protection, and it could lose about $45 million at vpg. the allen park, mich.-based company got its loan to build wheelchair-accessible vans. about 25 percent of the company models ran on compressed natural gas, a feature that helped it win the loan.",1
"toyota and tesla teaming up to build electric car. toyota ceo akio toyoda said his company will invest $50 million in tesla when the company begins selling stock to the public, and tesla ceo elon musk said his company will purchase the new united motor manufacturing inc., known as nummi, in fremont where the model s electric sedan will be built. we e going to create electric cars together, musk told a news conference at tesla office in palo alto. it a great honor to work with a company like toyota, one of the automobile leaders of the world and one i e personally long admired toyoda flew in from japan to make the announcement a day after both companies finalized the deals. i spent time at nummi and learned much about working in america there, so i feel a sense of attachment , toyoda said. the news stunned city officials from downey, who expected to vote thursday on a lease deal allowing tesla to rent 20 acres of city property south of los angeles. downey spent months courting the automaker to locate its factory there, and officials said they were certain of clinching a deal after meeting with musk recently. tesla has been extremely disingenuous in their dealing with downey, and i now have new appreciation as to why america is fed up with many large corporations, downey councilman mario guerra said. this last-minute betrayal is even more shocking because was hours away from signing the lease with tesla that would have been an economic boon for the city downey had offered to waive $6.9 million in rent in hopes that the plant could create up to 1,200 jobs and revitalize its reputation as southern california high-tech hub. musk said there was no effort to mislead downey officials, adding that parts of the deal with toyota were only resolved wednesday. we weren sure could a deal be put together, could tesla afford nummi, musk said. these were question marks that that were only resolved yesterday tesla, which currently makes a two-seater electric sports car costing $109,000, said its goal is to produce increasingly affordable electric cars. it has been scouting for a site to build the model s, which is scheduled to go on sale in 2012. the model s is slated to sell for $49,900, including federal tax credits, and is designed to travel as far as 300 miles on a three- to five-hour charge. the nummi plant, established in 1984 as a joint venture between general motors co. and toyota, employed 4,700 workers. gm made the pontiac vibe there but withdrew from the alliance last year after filing for bankruptcy protection. toyota made the corolla sedan and tacoma pickup at the plant but said in august that without gm, it could not sustain the factory. the last of nearly 8 million vehicles that moved through the sprawling facility rolled off the lot last month. the fate of the plant had been unclear. at its closure, plant executives said some employees would stay on while they try to sell off equipment and clean up. executives also said the plant would try to find a buyer and work with city and state officials to identify the best new use for the site. musk would not disclose what tesla paid for the factory. it bought only a parcel of the sprawling nummi plant. he said there is a lot of potential for long-term growth and that he sees the partnership eventually generating about 10,000 jobs between suppliers and factory workers. he said tesla already has started hiring former nummi employees and plans to add workers at a rate of about 50 a month. nummi was a union shop, and musk said tesla was neutral on any possible guild organization it would neither encourage or fight such an effort.",0

"rinspeed reveals tesla model s-based xchangee autonomous concept traveling in a driverless car will no longer require me to stare at the road, but will let me spend my time in a more meaningful way, rinspeed boss frank m. rinderknecht said in a statement. so far hardly anyone has taken this to its logical conclusion from the perspective of the driver so what does rinspeed see this entailing? for starters, a car steering wheel, when not in use, can be moved to the center of the dash in order to maximize space. regular car seats can then be replaced with airline-style tilting seats that make it possible for occupants to work or relax while riding in the car. in the xchange concept, the seats have 20 different levels of adjustment--a world record. a new type of interface is also possible, as demonstrated by tech company harman in the xchange. it features functions for navigation, entertainment, assistance and services that are displayed on a total of four screens located around the cabin. a main display running the length of the dash provides important information in wide-screen format, while a 32-inch monitor in the rear transforms the xchange into a cinema on wheels. of course the xchange is also fully networked with the outside world via car-2-car and car-2-object technology, lte high-speed data transfer and a custom communications platform developed solely for the concept. as rinspeed explains, you could read, listen to music, surf the web, play games and watch movies on the way to work, or you can hold a four-party meeting and work on your files while brewing a fresh cup of coffee. like most of rinspeed concepts, the xchange isn destined for production, but many of its features are likely to appear on future cars. that because many of them were developed together with major auto industry suppliers including trw, harman, georg fischer automotiv and evonik. the rinspeed xchangee will be shown for the first time at the 2014 geneva motor show on march 4. for more from the show, visit our dedicated hub.",1
"consumer reports test shows how tesla autopilot can operate without anyone in the driver seat. the 2021 cadillac escalade is available with the latest version of gm hands-free super cruise highway driving aid. fox news autos editor gary gastelu lets it take him for a ride. consumer reports dmonstrates how a tesla can be tricked into operating in autopilot without anyone in the driver seat. jake fisher, consumer reports senior director of auto testing, took the organization own tesla model y onto its private test track, which features lane markers like a highway, and set the speed to 0 mph with autopilot engaged and the seatbelt buckled behind him. the organization has previously determined that unbuckling the belt or opening a door will disengage the system. fisher then strapped a weight onto the steering wheel to mimic the torque created by someone hand holding it, which is how the car primarily monitors whether or a driver is paying attention. tesla says it will disengage after a period of time if it doesn sense someone touching the wheel, but that period is not specified and inconsistent depending on the circumstances. some tesla drivers have used similar methods to fisher to defeat the monitoring system for videos posted to social media platforms. elon musk autopilot and safety claims not iron clad. once the weight was in place, he slipped into the front passenger seat and used the speed control on the steering wheel to increase the speed to 30 mph. the car accelerated to that speed and continued down the track without offering any warnings that it was being misused. consumer reports noted that this was meant to highlight autopilot basic lack of driver awareness capability, rather than offer specific insight into the texas crash, the circumstances of which are not fully known, but which took place on a residential road without lane markers. elon musk said it was not possible for autopilot to operate on a road without lines and that data recovered from the car showed that neither autopilot or the more advanced full self-driving feature were engaged at the time of the crash, but his claims have not yet been independently verified. however, following the crash, one tesla owner did post a now-viral video to twitter of his tesla autopilot functioning on a residential street without any lane markers this isn the first time consumer reports has criticized tesla driver awareness method. it has given general motors hands-off super cruise a higher rating due to the facial recognition technology it uses to ensure the driver is in the seat and watching the road. tesla has recently started to test an in-car camera installed in the model 3 and model y for this purpose with its more advanced full self-driving system, but it clear from the consumer reports test that it is not currently in use in all vehicles with autopilot.",2

"elon musk says saudi arabia sovereign wealth fund may help take tesla private. saudi arabia sovereign wealth fund would be the main source of money for tesla ceo elon musk grand plan to take the company private, but the deal isn done yet, musk disclosed in a blog on monday. the fund approached musk about going private multiple times during the past two years, and musk says he left a july 31 meeting with no question that the deal could be closed. that why he tweeted on aug. 7 that he had funding secured to take the company private. it is that phrase that may lead to trouble for musk. if the tweet is deemed by regulators to be a factual statement, and it was taken as such by investors who drove shares up 11 percent on that day, musk could be at risk for securities fraud if it wasn entirely true. already there are reports that the u.s. securities and exchange commission is looking into musk tweet. funding for the deal would come from the ultraconservative kingdom public investment fund, one of the world largest sovereign wealth funds. founded in 1971, the fund has some $250 billion in investments across the world, according to the sovereign wealth fund institute, based in las vegas. among its holdings include a $3.5 billion stake in the ride-sharing app uber. a fund spokesman declined to comment monday night in riyadh. musk blog , posted before the markets opened monday, didn impress investors much. shares fell $3.10 to $352.39 in midday trading. under his proposal, only investors who don want to remain with a private company would be paid, and funding for the deal would come from tesla stock, not debt. musk wrote that he expects about one-third of shareholders to take an offer of $420 per share, making the buyouts worth roughly $23.6 billion. presumably the wealth fund and perhaps other investors would put up the money to buy the shares and would be repaid in tesla equity. musk wrote that at the july 31 meeting, the fund managing director strongly expressed his support for taking the electric car and solar panel maker private. i understood from him that no other decision makers were needed and that they were eager to proceed, musk wrote in the blog. but the deal appeared to be far from finished. since the meeting, the men have continued discussions and the managing director has expressed support subject to financial and other due diligence and their internal review process for obtaining approvals, musk wrote. the wealth fund recently bought nearly 5 percent of tesla shares. the fund chairman is saudi arabia assertive 32-year-old crown prince mohammed bin salman. he has used the fund as a vehicle to achieve economic goals of increasing employment in the kingdom, as well as for floating a possible public offering of the state oil giant saudi aramco, though that effort appears to have stalled. tesla has a growing following on the arabian peninsula, with a glittering new showroom in the skyscraper-studded city of dubai in the united arab emirates. musk has visited the region as well and given talks. musk wrote in monday blog that he made the aug. 7 announcement because he had talked to large investors about his desire to take the company private. it wouldn be right to share information about going private with just our largest investors without sharing the same information with all investors at the same time, he wrote. he wrote that he was speaking for himself as a potential bidder for the company. musk also wrote that the saudis are interested in the company because they want to diversify away from oil. musk continues to speak with other investors because he wants tesla to continue to have a broad investor base, he wrote. tesla wouldn comment on a possible sec investigation or why it took a week for details to be released in the blog. the sec also would not comment monday. late on friday, musk used twitter to taunt investors who have bet against his company, despite the possible sec investigation. the tweets were aimed at shorts, or investors who borrow shares of tesla and immediately sell them with the hope that tesla share price will fall. that allows the shorts to buy back the stock at a lower price, return the shares to the lender, and pocket the difference. on friday, two lawsuits were filed accusing musk of seeking to harm short sellers by artificially running up the price of the company shares. by taking tesla private, musk believes that the company will be able to sharpen its long-term focus of revolutionizing an automobile industry dominated by fuel-combustion vehicles without having to cater to investors fixation on how the business is faring each quarter. ____. jon gambrell in dubai and marcy gordon in washington, d.c., contributed to this report.",1

"tesla motors dealing as states play factory poker. file - in this june 22, 2012 file photo, tesla ceo elon musk waves during a rally at the tesla factory in fremont, calif. musk has five states bidding up subsidy packages to land a coveted plant for a $5 billion factory to make batteries for a new generation of tesla electric cars it not just the project massive scale, the cutting-edge technology, or even the bonanza of 6,500 good-paying jobs. it how tesla is deciding where to build. through a series of unusual plays, tesla has five states bidding up subsidy packages to land the coveted plant. the winner is expected to offer the luxury car-maker publicly financed incentives exceeding a half-billion dollars. tesla signaled this would be no ordinary competition last fall, when it gathered economic development officials from seven western states and unveiled its vision for a gigafactory this spring, ceo elon musk announced tesla would take the extremely unusual step of spending millions to prepare sites in two states - or perhaps even three - before the finalist was chosen. then, over the summer, musk said the winning state would pitch in about 10 percent of the cost, effectively signaling a minimum bid of $500 million. we don usually see companies setting a floor at which states will be considered, said leigh mcilvaine of the research group good jobs first, which tracks large subsidy packages by states. for all the public anticipation musk has created, much about the process remains secret. while an industrial park in the desert outside reno, nevada, is one known site, the other - or others - remains a mystery. tesla has asked states not to discuss their offers, and states aren talking. the effect is a game of high-stakes poker, with the states as players and tesla dealing. you can see any cards at all. do you stay in or not, push more chips onto the table or fold? said kim hill, who studies incentives at the nonprofit center for automotive research in michigan. the factory promises something that every state wants but rarely gets these days: thousands of good-paying factory jobs and all the residual economic benefits they bring. so far, nevada, california, texas, arizona and new mexico remain contenders. they have passed tax breaks, promised worker-training funds or proposed shelving environmental regulations that could slow the factory construction. there is talk of special legislative sessions to sweeten the bids. when the associated press filed public records act requests for documents about the competition with each of the five finalist states, none released much useful information and most refused to release anything at all, citing the competitive need to keep their offers secret. in one glimpse behind the curtain of confidentiality, california provided an email from a tesla official to the governor senior adviser for jobs and economic development. it contained a newspaper story speculating on a possible site and said, simply: this is unhelpful. what might be unhelpful was unclear, and the governor office of business and economic development refused repeated requests to discuss its pursuit of the factory. tesla needs the factory to make cheaper batteries for its model 3, a mass-market electric car the company hopes to sell by 2017 for around $35,000. currently tesla only offers the model s sedan, which starts at $70,000. the tight production timeframe compels tesla to prepare at least two sites, said spokesman simon sproule, who likened the approach to an insurance policy tesla will pay about half of the factory cost; the other major investor is panasonic, which will manufacture the lithium-ion battery cells and invest in equipment. musk has said to expect groundbreaking on at least one other site in coming months and a final decision by year end. the last comparable bidding frenzy for a factory, according to john boyd of the new jersey-based site selection firm the boyd company, involved competition to attract automaker saturn in the 1980s, at the leading edge of the south car manufacturing boom. the competition for the gigafactory began at an october meeting at tesla auto assembly plant in the san francisco bay area city of fremont - a rare approach to opening a site selection process. tesla executives laid out what a winning bid must have: green energy such as solar or wind at a low cost, an affordable and well-trained labor force, good transportation links to tesla fremont assembly plant. and a robust package of incentives. tesla required states to submit their proposals within three weeks, an early indication of influence the company would wield. given the scale, it was a very short turnaround time, said susan st. germain, the lead business recruiter for washington, who attended the meeting but whose state did not make the short list. along the way, there has been plenty of political theater. texas gov. rick perry drove to california state capitol in a tesla and california state sen. ted gaines delivered a gold-painted shovel to tesla headquarters. cities in both states pitched tesla directly. tucson, arizona, sent the company a preapproved building permit. the director of the industrial park outside reno where tesla prepared land said he seen plenty of secrecy before, but never anything like this. it has been a very, very unusual transaction, said lance gilman of the reno tahoe industrial center, which at 167 square miles is the nation largest industrial park. they have played their cards so close to the vest texas has done business with musk before. the state is providing his commercial space company, spacex, $15.3 million in incentives to develop a rocket-launching site. the money comes from what is regarded as the nation most generous deal-closing fund of incentives, which has doled out $487 million since 2003. new mexico governor has said that, if needed, she will ask the legislature to consider changes in law to help land the plant. california gov. jerry brown got lawmakers to pass language helping battery manufacturers, and musk said brown is working to address his concerns that california arduous environmental reviews would make the project three-year timeframe impossible to meet. nevada may hold a special session of its part-time legislature to discuss incentives. there kind of a bidding war out there with the state of california and the state of texas, said u.s. senate majority leader harry reid, d-nev. we l have to wait and see. i not going to start counting the jobs until it happens ",0

"is tesla selling its cars illegally?. tesla motors gallery in houston galleria, opened october 2011, with model s on display . tesla, you may remember, is selling its electric cars online, not through franchised, independently owned dealers, and delivering them directly to buyers from the factory. in doing so, tesla motors [nsdq:tsla] has removed the two parts of car shopping that customers clearly hate most: haggling and buying. its tesla stores, it says, are simply educational showrooms where no cars are actually sold. dealer groups--who view the approach as a dire threat--do not believe this, and they are both changing state laws and suing tesla to prevent the company from opening its stores. by the beginning of this month, tesla faced lawsuits in four states over its stores. conciliatory, polite. on monday, tesla ceo elon musk weighed in, posting what was for him a relatively polite, conciliatory response to those challenges on the company website. in many respects, he wrote, it would be easier to pursue the traditional franchise dealership model, which would save tesla money and broaden its distribution much more quickly. the problem, he argued, is that any conventional dealer has a fundamental conflict in explaining the advantages of battery electric cars when they rely on gasoline vehicles for the bulk of their sales and profits. the 2012 tesla model s is so different from any other car, he said, that consumers require a great deal of education before they can even start to think about buying. that what the tesla stores do, he wrote: let the public learn about the model s from product specialists--who are not on commission--and, critically, about electric cars in general. their goal and the sole metric of their success is to have you enjoy the experience of visiting so much that you look forward to returning again, musk said. contrary to spirit of the law?. he acknowledged existing state laws and pledged that tesla follows them. we do not seek to change those rules, he wrote, and we have taken great care not to act in a manner contrary to those rules in respect to two lawsuits filed against the company, he said tesla believes they are starkly contrary to the spirit and the letter of the law musk noted that they were filed in one case by a fisker dealer, and in the other, by an auto group that has repeatedly demanded that it be granted a tesla franchise he also noted that u.s.-style franchise laws do not exist elsewhere in the world, and described tesla plans for service facilities in some detail. laws in 48 states. in 48 states, according to the national automobile dealers association , franchise laws forbid or severely restrict the ability of automakers to sell vehicles directly to the public. the specific wording of those laws varies from state to state, but most are based on the rationale that letting big automakers sell cars to customers would stifle competition. and there some history--from half a century ago--that supports the notion that franchised auto dealers may face unfair competition from factory stores selling the same cars. tesla motors, of course, doesn have a single franchised dealer. it has only factory showrooms, and the only way to purchase a tesla model s is to order it online. [update: yesterday, nada upped the ante. it said in an e-mailed statement it was seeking a meeting with the startup automaker to explore serious concerns about tesla intentions its chairman william underriner told reporters the dealers group has a whole mess of lawyers in washington who work on state franchise laws, which presumably nada could deploy in every state where tesla has or seeks to open a store or service facility.]. changing colorado law. but dealers insist that tesla showroom workers are part of the sales process, even though they can take money for cars. they view that as a violation of state laws, and are fighting the company on several fronts. in colorado, for instance, the state dealer association got a bill passed in 2010 that amended the laws governing dealer operations and their business arrangements with automakers. the bill, which was signed on march 22, 2010 and took effect immediately, prohibited tesla from opening any further stores in the state. as the association wrote in its 2010 end of session report:. an existing provision in colorado law already prevented a manufacturer from operating a dealership so long as they were not [sic] franchised dealerships. this statue [sic] narrows provision [sic] so a manufacturer that has any dealerships in colorado, whether franchised or not, is prohibited from operating a dealership. a tesla store in colorado had opened in 2009, spurred in part by interest in a then-active $42,000 tax credit for the purchase of a tesla roadster. asked for comment on the 2010 colorado legislation, tesla spokeswoman shanna hendriks said only:. tesla business model was developed in the best interests of consumers and the advancement of electric vehicle technology. in doing so, we have worked closely with regulators to operate within compliance of all current state and municipal laws. that as close to a no comment as you l get. tesla currently has just one colorado facility, in lone tree, south of denver. dealerships: the best way to protect buyers. two weeks ago, tim jackson, president of the colorado automobile dealers association, spoke at length with green car reports on dealers reasons for opposing the tesla model and fighting its stores. it really, he explained, all about protecting consumers. he offered three different reasons for the group action. first, he said, independent dealerships usually continue in business to provide service even if an auto company or brand shuts down the supply of new cars. if tesla were to fail, he pointed out, it would close all its company-owned stores and service facilities, leaving tesla owners without recourse. owners of oldsmobiles, pontiacs, hummers, saabs, daewoos, isuzus, and other vanished makes got varying access to service and parts through independent dealerships long after they disappeared from the market, he maintained. second, the dealers feel--as musk acknowledged in his letter--that tesla could spend its money much more wisely than on building its own stores. imagine, jackson suggested, what tesla could do if it applied the money it now spending on stores and service centers to its product development plans instead. and third, he argued, all auto dealers will be hurt if tesla fails. if that were to happen, and consumers were left high and dry without a place to have their tesla cars serviced, he said, it would do great damage to the good reputation of all auto dealers. jackson acknowledged that most car buyers have no idea automakers are legally forbidden from selling cars to them directly. he reiterated the association position that the public is best protected by having independently owned dealerships, rather than direct sales by carmakers. like apple, like tesla. the model for the tesla stores is none other than apple outrageously successful chain of retail shops. in fact, both companies stores have been designed by the same man, george blankenship. the [traditional] model is that [carmakers] do a bunch of research, hold a bunch of focus groups, and they decide that this is a car we should build, blankenship said at the july opening of the portland store. they design that car, they engineer it and manufacture it, and then they sell it to some dealer who then tries to sell it that just not how we e doing it meanwhile, tesla has said it had already logged more than 1 million visitors in its various stores by mid-july. and the company is moving forward with plans to open 10 more stores in high-end locations by the end of this year. heading into january, musk wrote, tesla will have 19 stores, three galleries, and 26 service centers in the u.s.--including service centers in cities where it has no showrooms. view original post.",2

"nhtsa investigating fatal california tesla crash. the national highway traffic safety administration is investigating the crash of a speeding tesla that killed two people in a los angeles suburb, the agency announced tuesday. agency spokesman sean rushton wouldn say whether the tesla model s was on autopilot when it crashed on dec. 29 in gardena. that system is designed to automatically change lanes and keep a safe distance from other vehicles. the black tesla had left a freeway and was moving at a high rate of speed when it ran a red light and slammed into a honda civic at an intersection, police said. a man and woman in the civic died at the scene. a man and woman in the tesla were hospitalized with non-life threatening injuries. no arrests were immediately made. an nhtsa statement said the agency has assigned its special crash investigation team to inspect the car and the crash scene. that team has inspected a total of 13 crashes involving tesla vehicles that the agency believed were operating on the autopilot system. results were published in two of those cases, one of which involved autopilot. results are pending in the other 10 cases, the agency said in a statement. messages were left tuesday night seeking comment from tesla. another tesla crash killed a woman sunday in indiana. state police said the driver, derrick n. monet, 25, of prescott valley, arizona, was seriously injured after he rear-ended a fire truck parked along interstate 70 in putnam county. his wife, jenna n. monet, 23, was pronounced dead at a hospital. teen tesla driver lost control due to excessive speed prior to fatal fiery crash. derrick monet told investigators he regularly uses his tesla autopilot mode, but didn recall whether he had it activated at the time of the accident, state police sgt. matt ames said. earlier this month, a tesla struck a police cruiser and a disabled vehicle in connecticut but nobody was seriously hurt. the driver told state police that he was using the autopilot system and had looked around to check on his dog in the back seat. both tesla and the nhtsa have advised that advanced driver assist systems such as autopilot aren entirely autonomous but require human drivers to pay attention at all times. but several crashes - some fatal - have been blamed on driver inattention linked to overconfidence in such systems. in one crash report, the national transportation safety board referred to it as automation complacency the national transportation safety board has criticized tesla autopilot. in september, that agency said that in a 2018 crash in culver city where a tesla hit a fire truck, the design of the autopilot system permitted the driver to disengage from the driving task. nobody was hurt in that accident. the ntsb determined in september 2017 that design limitations of the tesla model s autopilot played a major role in a may 2016 fatal crash in florida involving a vehicle operating under autopilot. but it blamed the crash on an inattentive tesla driver over-reliance on technology and a truck driver who made a left turn in front of the car ",0

"tesla is designing a ventilator using car parts, but hasn released production plans yet. tesla has released a video that shows prototypes for a ventilator it working on that was designed with car parts. unlike ford and gm, which are helping device companies swiftly ramp up production of their existing products, tesla said its goal is to develop a ventilator that doesn tap into the existing parts supply chain tesla design plugs into a hospital oxygen supply and mixes the o2 with ambient air using a chamber borrowed from one of its adjustable air suspension systems. from there, it works its way through a custom valve body, flow rate sensor, pressure sensor and filter before being pumped into the patient lungs. the prototype is controlled by the vehicle controllers, touchscreen and infotainment system computer from a tesla model 3 and features a backup battery and compressor that can be used with a portable oxygen tank in case of a power outage or to transport the patient the automaker didn offer a timeline for when it expects to have an fda-approved production-ready version of the device or where it will be built, but elon musk had previously suggested it could possibly manufacture ventilators at tesla idled solar-panel factory in buffalo, while the model 3 is manufactured at its fremont, calif., and shanghai, china, facilities tesla has previously donated several hundred bpap machines that can be used to help treat less severe cases of covid-19 ",1

"tesla electric sedan rated at 89 mpg-e with 265 mile range deliveries of the first $87,900 sedans are set to begin on friday. tesla had previously promised that the car would go 300 miles per charge, but cites a change to the testing procedure as the reason for the lower official number. nevertheless, the figure is more than triple that of its nearest competitor, the coda, which has an epa rated range of 88 miles. the model s achieves its long range with the use of the largest battery yet installed in a production electric car, an 85 kilowatt-hour lithium-ion pack that would take over two days to charge on a 110v household outlet, but just four to nine hours when using a 240v charger. tesla is also building a network of public superchargers on interstate highways that can fill the pack half way in 30 minutes. the model s is being billed as a zero emissions competitor to cars like the bmw 5-series, and features a hatchback design that can accommodate a pair of child-size rear facing jump seats in the cargo area making it a 7-passenger vehicle. the 89 mpg-equivalent rating is calculated by comparing the amount of energy in a gallon of gasoline to that used in the form of electricity by the model s. the highest mileage car rated so far is the smaller, less powerful honda fit ev, with a rating of 118 mpg-e. while the first tesla sedans going to customers are top of the line signature editions loaded with options, a more basic $69,900 version will go on sale later this year. it will be followed by two shorter range models powered by 40 and 60 kwh battery packs with starting prices of $49,900 and $59,900, respectively. read: tesla electric suv to fly on falcon wings .",0
