"is this what tesla's 'cybertruck' pickup will look like?. tesla's electric truck is taking shape. ever since elon musk announced plans for tesla to build a pickup, the internet has been littered with speculative renderings of what it might look like. they range from a tesla model x with a bed to bizarre creations based on musk's description of the still-secret vehicle featuring ""sci-fi"" or ""cyberpunk"" styling. tesla even released one of its own that depicted a giant futuristic vehicle big enough to fit a conventional full-size pickup in its bed. (tesla). it followed that up with a shadowy teaser image of an unidentified part of the truck, but now musk is offering new insight into the bigger picture. (tesla). responding to a twitter follower who asked if any of the images out there were close to the real deal, musk said, ""cybertruck doesn't look like anything i've seen bouncing around the internet. it's closer to an armored personnel carrier from the future."". while that description brings to mind a hollywood version of something like the general dynamics land systems canada lav (light armored vehicle) or st kinetics terrex, neither of those have a pickup bed or anything resembling a conventional cabin. however, there is one that does. (st kinetic). the mantis was designed by israeli engineering firm carmor and it wouldn't look out of place in a big-budget blockbuster action film. (carmor). the monster truck features a windshield that blends directly into the hood, a central seating position (similar to tesla's upcoming semi truck) and can be configured with a small bed that's really more for a soldier to stand on while operating a roof-mounted machine gun, but could probably handle a run to costco. (carmor). will tesla's pickup look anything like this? the world will find out sometime in november when musk promises he'll be pulling the wraps off of what he claims will be a better truck than a ford f-150 and a better sports car than a porsche 911.",0
"tesla pays off government loan nine years early.. file - in this june 22, 2012 file photo, tesla workers cheer on the first tesla model s cars sold during a rally at the tesla factory in fremont, calif. the tesla motors inc. model s electric car has tied an older lexus for the highest score ever recorded in consumer reports magazine's automotive testing on thursday, may 9, 2013. (ap photo/paul sakuma, file) (ap). the palo alto, calif., company said it wired in a $451.8 million payment to the government on wednesday. the money, coupled with two prior payments, paid off a $465 million loan tesla got from the department of energy loan in 2010 to foster development of advanced-technology vehicles. tesla used money from a $968 million stock and note sale that closed wednesday to repay the debt. the repayment is good for tesla's image because the company no longer owes taxpayers money. and the government quickly touted the payment as an example of a success from an energy department loan program used to start clean-energy companies. the $34 billion loan portfolio has seen several high-profile defaults, including solar panel maker solyndra, plus a potential default by electric car maker fisker automotive. but the energy department said in a statement that losses to date amount to 2 percent of the portfolio, or about $680 million. the department said it has helped to start 19 new clean-energy power plants that have added enough solar, wind and geothermal generating capacity to power a million homes. ""when you're talking about cutting-edge clean-energy technologies, not every investment will succeed,"" energy secretary ernest moniz said. tesla sells only one car, the $70,000 model s, which the company says can travel up to 300 miles on a charge at 55 mph. earlier this month, tesla reported its first quarterly profit. its stock price has more than doubled since the first of the year and closed wednesday at $87.24. also in may, consumer reports magazine said the model s tied for the highest rating in the history of the magazine's auto testing. industry analysts say the success of the debt and stock offerings give the company working capital for the future and are a strong indicator of the market's confidence in the company, led by paypal billionaire and spacex founder elon musk. the payment helps tesla show its independence, said dougherty & co. analyst andrea james. ""it allows them to say, 'we're not dependent on low-interest financing from the government,'"" she said. it also lets musk thumb his nose at critics like republican presidential candidate mitt romney, who in the first presidential debate accused president barack obama of picking ""losers"" for putting money into tesla and fisker. tesla motors inc. is among five auto companies that got loans from the energy department to develop clean vehicles, including fisker, ford motor co., nissan motor co. and the vehicle production group llc. ford got a $5.9 billion loan, while nissan got $1.45 billion. the government is in danger of losing $171 million at fisker, which may soon seek bankruptcy protection, and it could lose about $45 million at vpg. the allen park, mich.-based company got its loan to build wheelchair-accessible vans. about 25 percent of the company's models ran on compressed natural gas, a feature that helped it win the loan.",1
"elon musk lists 5 more homes for $97 million as he tries to sell most possessions. elon musk just took another step in his quest to ""own no house."". the eccentric tesla chief listed five more california properties for nearly $100 million after vowing to ditch most of his possessions. (paul hennessy/nurphoto via getty images). musk is seeking $62.5 million for four properties in los angeles's swanky bel-air neighborhood, according to a wednesday zillow listing describing the plots as ""a project for the big thinker"" with ""one of the best views in los angeles."". (google earth). musk also put his century-old san francisco-area mansion with ""unobstructed bay views"" on the market last week with an asking price of $35 million. he bought the 10-bedroom, 16,000-square-foot spread for $23.3 million in 2017, according to zillow. the latest bel air listing is down the road from a mansion musk listed earlier this month following his revelation on twitter that he was selling ""almost all physical possessions"" and would ""own no house."". the 48-year-old billionaire is also seeking $9.5 million for a ranch-style property once owned by gene wilder. musk has said the ""blazing saddles"" star's former home, which he bought in 2013, ""cannot be torn down or lose any (of) its soul."". the homes are part of musk's sprawling real estate portfolio comprising nine california properties, according to a wall street journal report. musk - who is worth $35.9 billion, according to forbes - has suggested that material possessions are a distraction from more lofty goals like getting to mars or shifting the world to sustainable energy. ""they're kind of an attack vector,"" musk said on a recent episode of joe roga                                                              n's podcast. ""[critics] say, 'hey billionaire, you've got all this stuff.' well, now i don't have any stuff. now what are you going to do?"". but musk's pledge to sell his properties came alongside another may 1 tweet saying tesla's stock price was ""too high,"" which led shares in the electric-car maker to tank as much as 13 percent that day. the message alarmed corporate governance experts because musk agreed to have a lawyer review his tweets about tesla in a 2019 deal with the securities and exchange commission. this story originally appeared in the new york post.",2
"consumer reports gives tesla model s highest rating ever.. (james lipman). chalk up another huge accolade for the tesla model s electric car: consumer reports has awarded it 99 out of 100 points, and said it's the best car the magazine has tested since 2007. in fact, the magazine's descriptions of the luxury sport sedan brim with adjectives. the tesla model s ""is brimming with innovation, delivers world-class performance, and is interwoven throughout with impressive attention to detail,"" writes the normally sober consumer publication. driving the model s electric car is ""like crossing into a promising zero-emissions future,"" and the version tested, with its 85-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack, is ""easily the most practical electric car we've tested."". cr reports that it gets a real-world 200 miles from that capacity, which is rated by the epa at 265 miles of range. (the 60-kwh version is rated at 208 miles.). the model s was lauded for its quiet operation, its acceleration and roadholding, and its efficiency. it wasn't perfect, cr noted, suffering a broken windshield that had to be replaced and a problem with the radio (fixed by a software update that was downloaded through the car's mobile-network connection). the missing point was docked because the model s takes roughly six hours to recharge its battery pack. jake fisher, cr's head of auto testing, put even that drawback in context when he enthused:  ""if it could recharge in any gas station in three minutes, this car would score about 110."". clearly the cr staff pretty much fell in love with the electric sport sedan. that stands in harsh contrast to its experience with the fisker karma range-extended electric car, which died during a track test and was raked over the coals in a scathing test report. the tesla model s doesn't yet receive a ""recommended"" rating from consumer reports, because the magazine doesn't yet have reliability data on the car, which has only been delivered since last summer. to read the magazine's full test report, you'll have to have a consumer reports login. but you can watch the magazine's video summary above.",1
"elon musk and malala are twitter bffs. (ap/spacex). elon musk and malala are new bffs after an exchange on twitter this week. it started when the human rights advocate retweeted a satirical story from clickhole that said the embattled tesla and spacex ceo had a new public relations problem after the tesla roadster he recently shot into space returned to earth and crashed into the nobel prize winner as she was walking down the street. musk then responded ""hi @malala"" to which she wrote back, ""i'm keeping the car btw!"". the spacex ceo didn't seem to have a problem with that, telling her ""finders keepers."". the two have a combined reach of over 23 million followers on the social media platform and are now following each other. unfortunately for malala, even if she did get the car, she couldn't get too far in it. the battery pack and electric motor, along with the windows, were all removed before it was loaded onto the falcon heavy rocket and blasted into a ""billion year elliptic mars orbit,"" that should keep her safe and sound for the time being.",0
"tesla suspending model 3 production for several days to address 'production bottlenecks'. tesla's highly automated freemont, calif., factory. (tesla). tesla is suspending production of its model 3 sedan for four or five days this week in order to make some tweaks to increase the speed of the process. the move comes just days after elon musk told cbs news that an overreliance on automation was preventing the automaker from ramping up production of its first mass-market model. ""yes, excessive automation at tesla was a mistake. to be precise, my mistake. humans are underrated,"" musk tweeted following the airing of the cbs report. this is the second time the line has been stopped in 2018, but a tesla representative said that both were pre-planned. ""these periods are used to improve automation and systematically address bottlenecks in order to increase production rates."". industry analyst dave sullivan of autopacific told bloomberg news that the shutdown was unusual. ""traditional automakers adjust bottlenecks on the fly during a launch. this is totally out of the ordinary,"" sullivan said. tesla reached a build rate of 2,000 model 3s per week at the end of march, which was short of its target of 2,500. it is now aiming to hit 5,000 per week before july. model s and x production will continue during the pause in model 3 output.",2
"tulsa unveils gigantic elon musk statue to help lure tesla to town. elon musk is now a true giant of industry. tulsa has transformed its landmark 75-foot-tall golden driller statue into a likeness of the tesla ceo in a bid to convince him to open a new factory in the oklahoma metropolis. (koki/nns). the statue, which is the fifth-tallest in the continental u.s. and stands outside the tulsa expo center, was built in the 1960s as a tribute to the state's petroleum industry. its electrifying makeover included replacing its ""tulsa"" belt buckle with one that says ""tesla,"" adding the automaker's logo to its chest and painting its face to resemble musk's. tesla is currently looking for a location for a second u.s. automotive manufacturing facility to build its model y utility vehicle and upcoming cybertruck pickup, and has reportedly narrowed down its choices between tulsa and austin, texas. elon musk says the cybertruck has been shrunk, can float. the wednesday stunt was put on by the tesla owners of oklahoma, and supported by mayor g.t. bynum. bynum couldn't discuss details of any ongoing talks with the automaker but told tulsa world that the effort isn't about making austin look bad. ""i think this is about convincing people that tulsa is the best fit for tesla, and i really do believe that,"" bynum said. musk is yet to comment on tulsa's unique sales pitch. .",1
"tesla says it's unlikely their autopilot system was used in indianapolis crash.. the statement said that the company is cooperating with state officials investigating the crash.. tesla reported that the car had sustained too much damage to be able to transmit data to servers at the company. the data would have been able to tell if the driver had the car in autopilot.. autopilot limits the vehicle's speed to less than 35 miles per hour on the street. tesla says it is likely the system wasn't engaged due to the speed limits. witness statements and the damage to the car suggest the car was going faster than that, tesla said. ""we are deeply saddened to hear that this accident involved fatalities,"" the company said. witnesses reported that the vehicle was driving at a high speed when it hit a tree, crashed and caught fire, killing 27-year-old driver casey speckman and 44-year-old passenger kevin mccarthy. police spokesman maj. richard riddle said earlier thursday that investigators were looking at whether autopilot played a role in the accident. the system, which was introduced last year, can automatically drive the car at a set speed and keep it within its lane. drivers need to touch the wheel at certain intervals or the system will turn off. the associated press contributed to this report.",0
"after quick brake fix, consumer reports says it now recommends tesla model 3.

"tesla sues former employee for stealing autopilot information.. (tesla). according to the lawsuit, anderson was a non-technical program manager of tesla's autopilot team. anderson allegedly violated his contract by taking information, attempting to hire away at least a dozen employees, and destroying evidence to cover his tracks. the suit says anderson was attempting to gather resources for his own company while still employed by tesla. he is also accused of using urmson as a proxy to try to hire these employees away. anderson allegedly did all of this while on his tesla supplied laptop, at tesla's office, on tesla's time. anderson was fired immediately after taking his tesla laptop to urmson's house and accessed a file named ""recruiting targets."" in the end, the pair only managed to hire away two employees. the automaker said in the lawsuit that just because the attempts were mostly unsuccessful doesn't mean the act should be excused. there has been no statement from tesla, but, unsurprisingly, anderson has refuted all of the automaker's claims. in a statement to jalopnik, anderson claims this is just an attempt by tesla to stifle any innovation and competition. he also believes this is an attempt to destroy personal reputations. anderson joined tesla late in 2014 in order to oversee development of the then upcoming model x. he was in an role that, although not technical, oversaw the team working on the autopilot system. it's not fully clear how tesla became aware fully of anderson's actions. because he was fired the afternoon after meeting with urmson, it seems that the automaker had been monitoring the activating on anderson's tesla-owned laptop. tesla is seeking monetary, non-monetary, and punitive remedies in its lawsuit. tesla is also wants the defendants to pay any associated legal fees when the lawsuit ends. the lawsuit was filed the morning of january 26, so look for more news as the case moves forward.",0

"elon musk says tesla cybertruck update 'probably' coming soon. a cybertruck sneak peek is on the way. tesla ceo elon musk tweeted over the weekend that he expects to offer the next update on the upcoming electric pickup in the second quarter of this year. musk revealed in february that he had just seen the final design of the truck, which has apparently evolved from the prototype revealed in november 2019. he had previously said that tesla was aiming to make the final design an improvement over the show truck, which he has been seen driving around the los angeles area. musk added in the most recent tweet that the company's focus is on completing the austin, tex., factory where the cybertruck will be built using a uniquely developed method to manufacture its stainless steel body. his comments come as tesla's stock price has fallen from an all-time high close of 883.09 on january 26 to 597.95 on march 5 amid a broader drop in tech stocks and increasing competition in the electric car segment. during the company's last earnings call, musk said he hoped to see a few cybertrucks come off of the assembly line before the end of this year, but that full production won't begin before 2022. tesla has said that it has over 200,000 reservations for the pickup, which will have a starting price of $49,900 when it goes on sale this year, according to tesla's reservation website, and a $39,900 model is slated to be added to teh lineup in late 2022.",1
"tesla cancels full self-driving expansion ahead of major update. tesla has canceled a planned expansion of its full self-driving beta software test ahead of a major update reportedly launching in april.

"watching a tesla tech pull a kitten out of a bumper will warm your heart.. before you send elon musk a tweet, you should know that tesla does not build a version of the model x with a one-catpower drivetrain. it is not another one of the company's clever easter eggs, either. as it turns out, a kitten found its way behind the rear bumper and couldn't find its way out. the owner couldn't remove the bumper on his own, so he drove to the nearest service center and asked for help. we would love to read the repair order; ""customer states car makes cat-like noises."" a technician confirmed the presence of a small, furry, and presumably terrified creature trapped in the back of the car. extracting it required putting the model x on a lift and unbolting the rear underbody panel, which tesla installs on all of its models to make them more aerodynamic and, consequently, more efficient. an opening in the plastic part gave the kitten its first sight of daylight in about 14 hours, but it was too scared to jump out on its own. wearing thick gloves, the technician had to reach in the car's belly and pull the kitten out. the entire operation took less than a minute. there is no word on exactly how the kitten wound up behind the bumper of a tesla x. anyone who has ever owned a cat willtestify that they are crafty and flexible, so anything is possible. regardless, this story has a happy ending: one of the technicians working at the service center immediately decided to give the cat a new home.",1
"stephen king 'farts' in his tesla. (getty images). stephen king says he likes to make fart noises in his tesla, but the admission isn't quite as terrifying as it sounds. the ""christine"" author was responding to a tweet from elon musk explaining how to access the novelty features that are loaded into the infotainment system, which include a fireplace simulator, classic atari games and a fart app. king was apparently unaware that the whoopee cushion emulator had been added back in december, which allows the cars to play farts on demand, randomly or in sync with the turn signal. ""okay. i'm sort of liking the ""fart"" app. pretty stupid, but also quite amusing,"" king wrote. musk returned the admiration, responding ""it's an honor, sir! thanks for owning a tesla."". interestingly, musk recently revealed that an upcoming sentry mode security feature will play bach's ""toccata and fugue in d minor"" if it detects that someone has broken into the vehicle. that's the creepy song you hear in pretty much every classic horror film and haunted house and pretty much right up king's alley. king has tweeted about his tesla before and once said it was like driving an x-wing fighter after taking it to a drag strip. read more about tesla from fox news autos.",0

"tesla responds to chinese hack with a major security upgrade.. (tesla). tesla could have reacted by fixing any one of the bugs to block the attack. instead, it went further, implementing a more fundamental security feature that will make the next hack of its vehicles more difficult for even sophisticated hackers to pull off. tesla added a measure that requires any new firmware written to components on the can bus-the internal network of computers that control everything from steering and brakes to windshield wipers-be digitally signed with a cryptographic key only tesla possesses. the new protection, known as code signing, was pushed out wirelessly in a software update earlier this month to all tesla s cars and tesla x suvs. it amounts to far tighter control over who can reprogram sensitive components. the upgrade makes tesla's in-vehicle security systems less like a malware-prone windows pc and more like a locked-down iphone. ""cryptographic validation of firmware updates is something we've wanted to do for a while to make things even more robust,"" says tesla's chief technical officer jb straubel. straubel notes that tesla has been working on the code-signing feature for months but accelerated its rollout when the tencent hackers reported their attack. the tesla security team pushed the fix to all tesla s and x vehicles within ten days. the feature, he says, should be considered a standard for the auto industry, hardening cars' internal networks even against hackers who have found an initial foothold in the form of another software flaw. ""this is what the world needs to move towards,"" straubel says. ""otherwise the door is thrown wide open anytime anyone finds a new vulnerability."". why your car's more hackable than your iphone. in fact, code signing has been a widespread feature in pcs and smartphones for years. it's what prevents you from installing an app on your iphone that didn't come from apple's app store and triggers the warning about an untrusted application in windows or macos when you install a piece of software downloaded from the web. but as vehicles have become increasing digital, automated and internet-connected, code signing's cryptographic trust feature has been conspicuously missing from major automotive vendors' digital defenses. exactly which automakers implement the feature is tough to track, given the companies' lack of transparency around security. but the chevy impala that researchers hacked via onstar in 2010 lacked code signing. so did the 2014 jeep cherokee that hackers hijacked on the highway last year in a demonstration for wired. the jeep hack might still have been possible even if chrysler had used code signing to protect the vehicle's can network, says charlie miller, one of the two hackers who developed the attack. but, miller adds, ""it would have been so much harder we probably wouldn't have bothered trying."". still, major carmakers have resisted recommendations to implement code signing, says josh corman, a founder of the internet-of-things security nonprofit i am the cavalry. that's due in part to their disparate supply chains, dealers, aftermarket tools and mechanics, all of which would be affected if a detroit giant started requiring the same cryptographic validation of software changes that apple does. ""tesla's span of control over its parts and suppliers and dealers may afford a better security response,"" says corman. ""their ability to be nimble is objectively greater."". how the tesla s got hacked. to understand how code signing stymies car hackers, consider the blow-by-blow of the tencent hackers' attack, which they broke down for wired in a series of emails. the hackers first dug up a vulnerability in the tesla s' browser, which is based on the open source browser framework webkit. that bug allowed them to start running malicious code in the browser of any tesla that visited a carefully crafted website. to demonstrate how a tesla driver could be tricked into visiting a sabotage site, the hackers created their own wifi hotspot with the name ""tesla guest,"" a common wifi network name at tesla dealerships, and enabled access with the commonly shared password for dealership guest networks, which they found on the web. they configured their hotspot so that any tesla that auto-connects to the network would immediately load their malicious page. ""when the browser is on, its web access traffic will be redirected to our payload. then pwn!"" writes samuel lv, the director of tencent's keenlab security team, using the hacker jargon ""pwn"" to mean ""hack"" or ""take control of."" (tesla and tencent disagree as to whether the trick works without any interaction on the part of the user. tesla claims the user would have to manually connect to the malicious hotspot and then navigate to an infected website. the hackers haveargued the point with tesla founder elon musk on twitter.). the tencent hackers then used another vulnerability in the tesla's linux operating system to gain full privileges on the car's head unit, the computer in its dashboard. but even then the group couldn't send commands to critical driving functions like steering and brakes: the tesla s' head unit is separated from its can bus by a computer tesla calls a gateway, which only allows certain commands to be sent from the car's infotainment system to its driving components. to defeat that safeguard, the hackers simply overwrote the gateway's firmware with their own. without code signing, nothing prevents that tactic. here's their full demonstration video:. a big fix for a big problem. when tencent keenlab team shared its attack technique with tesla earlier this month, tesla quickly created patches for the browser vulnerability and the linux kernel flaw. but it also rushed to fix what cto straubel describes as the most serious problem the chinese hackers exposed: the ability for any hacker who gets deep enough into the vehicles' systems to rewrite the firmware of the driving components. ""the browser vulnerability is not the real issue,"" straubel says. ""we felt it was most relevant to respond to the piece that's the real risk."". straubel credits keenlabs' researchers for kickstarting tesla's move to push out its code signing upgrade. he says tesla will pay keenlabs' team a monetary reward for its work as part of company's bug bounty program. ""they did good work,"" straubel says. ""they helped us find something that's a problem we needed to fix. and that's what we did."". and if the rest of the auto industry is paying attention, they might take the lesson of that chinese hack to heart, too.",1
"elon musk, grimes' newborn''s name, x æ a-12, could hold up if challenged in court, legal expert says. elon musk and his girlfriend, singer grimes, recently revealed the name they gave to their first child together: x æ a-12. despite rules dictating how one may name their child, one legal expert argued that the tesla and space x headman may actually have a solid case if he elected to force the issue in court, pointing toward outdated laws that simply can't keep up with the changing times not only regarding technology but the language it has created in and of itself. ""our laws constantly lag the realities and possibilities,"" attorney harry nelson -- founder and managing partner of nelson hardiman, the largest los angeles-based boutique health care law firm and the second-largest in all of california -- told fox news. on wednesday, a california family law attorney told people magazine that despite the uniqueness of the newborn's name, there is little chance the moniker will actually stick in the eyes of the law. ""in california, you can only use the '26 characters' of the english language in your baby name,"" attorney david glass told the outlet. ""thus, you can't have numbers, roman numerals, accents, umlauts or other symbols or emojis. although an apostrophe, for a name like 'o'connor,' is acceptable."". elon musk, grimes announce birth of their first child together. celebrity divorce attorney christopher melcher, a partner of the los angeles-based family law firm walzer melcher, echoed the sentiment of glass, saying stipulations that a name may not carry with it -- any symbols or marks showing how it's pronounced -- are set in place for a reason. ""there are good reasons for these rules. names are entered into databases,"" melcher explained to fox news on wednesday.

      (jason kempin/getty images). nelson also told fox: ""we see this clash constantly as technology allows us to do things the law never imagined, in health care where old laws become obstacles, and, in this case, with names."". due to this notion, nelson believes it can possibly work in favor of musk's stance in a court of law. elon musk's girlfriend, singer grimes, reveals meaning of their baby's name. ""leave it to elon musk to be one of the first to push through the current limit on name creativity,"" he continued. ""it used to be when [the late singer] prince took on the symbol in place of his name, but i am guessing he never tried to register it with california's office of vital records."". ""if musk forces the issue, i expect the courts will rule in his favor to force a move beyond the constraints of our 26-letter alphabet,"" he added. in a snap shared to musk's twitter tuesday morning, the couple's son appears to be sleeping while an instagram filter placed tattoos around his eyes and forehead. the baby is grimes' first child. musk shares five sons from a previous marriage. musk's first son reportedly died of sudden infant death syndrome at 10 weeks old back in 2002. grimes, whose real name is claire boucher, discussed her pregnancy in march with rolling stone. the musician told the magazine she was expecting her child to be nocturnal, as the baby moved ""only"" at night during her pregnancy. grimes and musk have been dating since 2018.",0

"tesla chief expects electric car company profit in 2020.. elon musk, tesla chairman, product architect and ceo, speaks at the automotive news world congress in detroit, tuesday, jan. 13, 2015. (ap photo/paul sancya). ceo elon musk, speaking tuesday at an automotive conference, said tesla needs to show a profit, and will when it's selling 500,000 cars per year. he predicted that sales milestone will be reached in 2020, when its lower-cost car - the model 3 - is in full production. tesla, which was founded in 2003, has never made a full-year profit. the company based in palo alto, california, expects to sell around 33,000 model s sedans this year. speaking at the automotive news world congress, musk said tesla could make money under u.s. accounting standards ""if we weren't growing and investing great amounts of money."". in addition to developing the model 3 and a crossover, tesla recently reengineered its model s sedan to offer all-wheel drive. it's also building a $5 billion battery factory in nevada that is set to begin production in 2017. musk wouldn't say how many model s sedans tesla sold last year, citing its upcoming earnings report. he did say fourth-quarter sales fell in china because of customers' concerns about plugging in their vehicles if they live in apartment buildings. musk said that issue is being resolved as tesla expands its network of supercharging stations in china. he added that north america and europe saw a ""significant increase"" in sales. tesla shares fell 6 percent to $182 in after-hours trading. that's down 35 percent from their all-time high of $291.42 set in early september. in addition to the model 3 - which, at $35,000, would cost half the price of a model s - tesla is developing the model x suv, which is set to go on sale this summer after several delays. musk said technical difficulties with the crossover's unique rear doors, which open up instead of out, were the reason. ""i do have an issue with punctuality,"" musk joked. ""this car is really good. and i do not say these things lightly."". he said he wasn't concerned about competitors, including the chevrolet bolt, a $37,500 electric car with a 200-mile range that was introduced this week at the detroit auto show. general motors says the bolt could be on sale by 2017. ""i don't see it as a competitive threat because i think all cars will go electric,"" he said. ""it's not going to affect us, really."". musk said he wishes more automakers would take a risk on electric cars. low gas prices, he said, shouldn't hinder their adoption because electric cars are cheaper to run than gas-powered cars even if oil is $40 to $50 per barrel. ""i think there's going to be huge societal pressure towards electric cars,"" he said. ""they're just fundamentally better."". musk said he plans to lead tesla at least through high-volume production of the model 3. he may not always be ceo, he said, but he will play a role in the company ""as long as i'm alive."".",1

"tesla model s...convertible? newport takes top off popular ev.. (newport convertible engineering). more than three decades old, newport has undergone several convertible conversion projects in the past, chopping the top off virtually anything. conversions have ranged from the expected--mercedes coupes, bentleys, pony cars--to the bizarre, including jaguar xj and range rover convertibles, a subaru wrx convertible and six-wheeled versions of the mercedes g-wagen and range rover. must watch: mclaren 12c and lamborghini aventador flame battle: video. newport last made headlines by promising to cut the top off a nissan gt-r, but its tesla motors [nsdq:tsla] project could be even weirder. an anonymous chinese investor has apparently ordered 100 examples of the car, and the company aims to complete conversions at its california base, as well as dubai and barcelona. with a soft tonneau cover, conversion costs total $29,000--spiraling to $49,000 for a hard tonneau cover conversion. it's not a project to undertake lightly. the model s is constructed from aluminum, a light-weight material but not as easy to work with as steel. the tesla's massive roof--which broke a rollover-testing machine during nhtsa safety tests--contributes to the car's overall strength, so the car will likely require significant extra bracing to maintain its structure. given other conversions on newport's website, we're not sure the company will get away with the clean, sleek design shown in its computer-generated images either--it may require a roll hoop between the front and rear doors. newport says it has officially requested that tesla work with it to build another 5,000 model s convertibles ""for worldwide demand"". we reached out to tesla for comment, and received the following in response: ""we don't have any plans for a convertible at this time. we are very focused on developing model x and bringing our mass market vehicle to market in about three years."" that's a no, then--though newport claims a full announcement will be made on april 18.",0
"tesla says sec subpoenaed model 3 production information. (ap). u.s. securities investigators have subpoenaed information from tesla about production forecasts for the model 3 electric car that were made last year, the company acknowledged in a regulatory filing friday. the disclosure in tesla's quarterly financial report also says the securities and exchange commission subpoena covered other public statements made about model 3 production. the filing adds that tesla is cooperating with a justice department request for information about model 3 forecasts. it's the first time tesla has formally disclosed the sec subpoena in a regulatory filing, but there have been widespread news reports about its investigation into production forecasts. the model 3 is a central part of tesla's plan to expand from a niche player in the luxury segment to a car maker with broader appeal. it's also key to the company's cash flow and pledge to make quarterly net profits into the future. in 2017 and this year, tesla had trouble producing the cars, drawing a lawsuit from investors who said they were misled by ceo elon musk's production targets. early last year the palo alto, california, company announced plans to produce up to 5,000 model 3s a week by the end of 2017. but the company fell far short due to problems with automation at its fremont, california, factory, making just 793 in the last week of 2017 and 2,700 for the entire year. it didn't hit the 5,000-a-week target until june 2018. the wall street journal reported last month that the fbi is doing a criminal investigation into whether tesla misled investors by overstating model 3 production forecasts. tesla inc. says in the filing that to its knowledge, no government agency in an ongoing investigation has determined that it did anything wrong. a company spokesman wouldn't comment beyond the filing. messages were left friday seeking comment from the sec and the justice department. in september, tesla settled a civil lawsuit by the sec over tweets by musk that funding was in place to take the company private. musk and tesla agreed to pay a combined $40 million without acknowledging or denying wrongdoing. ""aside from the settlement with the sec relating to mr. musk's statement that he was considering taking tesla private, there have not been any developments in these matters that we deem to be material,"" the company wrote in the filing. but the company also says if the government decides to take enforcement action ""there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows, and financial position."". last month tesla reported a $311.5 million profit for the july-through-september period, its first quarterly profit in two years. the company said it produced about 4,300 model 3s a week, excluding planned shutdowns, and 5,300 in the final week of the quarter. a year ago, a group of shareholders sued the company in federal court alleging that it made false statements about model 3 production and misled investors. the original complaint was dismissed but was refiled in september. ""we believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously,"" the company said in its filing.",0
"consumer reports test shows how tesla's autopilot can operate without anyone in the driver seat.. the 2021 cadillac escalade is available with the latest version of gm's hands-free super cruise highway driving aid. fox news autos editor gary gastelu lets it take him for a ride. consumer reports dmonstrates how a tesla can be tricked into operating in autopilot without anyone in the driver's seat.. jake fisher, consumer reports senior director of auto testing, took the organization's own tesla model y onto its private test track, which features lane markers like a highway, and set the speed to 0 mph with autopilot engaged and the seatbelt buckled behind him. the organization has previously determined that unbuckling the belt or opening a door will disengage the system. fisher then strapped a weight onto the steering wheel to mimic the torque created by someone's hand holding it, which is how the car primarily monitors whether or a driver is paying attention. tesla says it will disengage after a ""period of time"" if it doesn't sense someone touching the wheel, but that period is not specified and inconsistent depending on the circumstances. some tesla drivers have used similar methods to fisher's to defeat the monitoring system for videos posted to social media platforms. elon musk's autopilot and safety claims not iron clad. once the weight was in place, he slipped into the front passenger seat and used the speed control on the steering wheel to increase the speed to 30 mph. the car accelerated to that speed and continued down the track without offering any warnings that it was being misused. consumer reports noted that this was meant to highlight autopilot's basic lack of driver awareness capability, rather than offer ""specific insight"" into the texas crash, the circumstances of which are not fully known, but which took place on a residential road without lane markers. elon musk said it was not possible for autopilot to operate on a road without lines and that data recovered from the car showed that neither autopilot or the more advanced full self-driving feature were engaged at the time of the crash, but his claims have not yet been independently verified. however, following the crash, one tesla owner did post a now-viral video to twitter of his tesla's autopilot functioning on a residential street without any lane markers. . this isn't the first time consumer reports has criticized tesla's driver awareness method. it has given general motors' hands-off super cruise a higher rating due to the facial recognition technology it uses to ensure the driver is in the seat and watching the road. tesla has recently started to test an in-car camera installed in the model 3 and model y for this purpose with its more advanced full self-driving system, but it's clear from the consumer reports test that it is not currently in use in all vehicles with autopilot.",2
"tesla takes $35,000 model 3 sales offline, but adds 3-year lease plan for its smallest car. tesla will no longer sell its entry-level $35,000 standard range model 3 online, and will instead require interested customers to call or visit a store to order one. the sedans will also be delivered with the higher capacity battery pack of the standard range plus model, but with a software restriction that limits their range from 240 to 220 miles. original and subsequent owners will be able to pay to have the additional range unlocked at any time. (tesla). tesla said the move was largely due to the fact that the plus has been outselling the standard range by a factor of 6 to 1. limiting the number of battery pack sizes it offers helps streamlines production, and the company has used a similar strategy several times previously to update the model s and x lineups. tesla model y debuts with $39,000 base price. the model y utility vehicle shares a platform with the model 3.
      (tesla). the base price of the plus has also been increased from $37,500 to $39,500, but it now comes with the semi-autonomous autopilot electronic driving aid, which was a $3,000 option. tesla's release on the changes said that ""all tesla vehicles now come with autopilot bundled as a standard feature,"" but fox news autos has confirmed that the feature is not active on the $35,000 version of the model 3. the rear-wheel-drive long range model 3 has also been removed from the website and joins the standard range model 3 as an off-menu model that must be ordered in-store or on the phone. along with the lineup changes, tesla announced its first leasing program for the model 3, which requires a $3,000 down payment, but does not allow leases to buy their car at the end of the 36-month term. that's because tesla is planning to use them for an autonomous ride-hailing service it expects to have up and running by then, which will also allow owners to hire out their vehicles when they are not using them. elon musk explains reason for tesla model 3's mysterious cockpit camera.",0

""i'm not going to let anything go, no matter what people offer, until i complete that mission."". range: the new model will have a range of about 200 miles, musk told bloomberg. timing: with the model x now going on sale at the end of 2014, musk said the new, smaller tesla will go into production in late 2016. if history is any guide, the design will likely be unveiled sometime in 2015. cost: the new model is planned to cost roughly half of what a model s does, with musk admitting that the large luxury sedan is ""too expensive for most people."". various estimates have ranged from $30,000--technically half of the now-canceled 40-kwh, $59,900 version of the model s--to less than $40,000. we suspect that tesla may be quoting post-incentive prices for the lower of those numbers. even by 2016, it seems unlikely that the company will have built the 200,000 vehicles that trigger a wind-down of the $7,500 federal purchase incentive. styling: musk said the generation iii car will have ""a family resemblance"" to the model s. battery technology: tesla has said nothing about its battery technology for the new vehicle, but we know that its cell partner and part owner panasonic continues to work on more energy-dense cells and cost reductions for high-volume cell fabrication. musk said at the annual meeting that it is working with panasonic on new chemistry for cells optimized for use in electric-car applications. he said he was ""pretty optimistic"" that the necessary advances in battery technology are achievable without ""any miracles happening."". tesla has not addressed the more interesting question of whether part of the cost reduction will come from using fewer, larger lithium-ion cells, as do other automakers. both the model s and tesla's earlier roadster model use several thousand small commodity cells wired together in their battery packs. other technology: musk hinted that the new line might have some elements of autonomous driving, but suggested those might not be offered right at the launch. with tesla and its silicon valley neighbor google working together, those elements might be based on google's research into self-driving cars. you can rest assured that between now and the launch of the next line of tesla cars and crossovers, there will be more coverage of every detail. lots more coverage. lots. more from green car reports.",0

"elon musk stirs the pot with cryptic 'red pill' tweet. get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. tech billionaire elon musk, who has emerged as a champion of defying stay-at-home orders intended to stop the coronavirus from spreading, stirred the pot with a cryptic tweet sunday. ""take the red pill,"" the tesla ceo wrote to his 34 million followers. some followers saw it as a sign that musk was pushing for the conservative cause. adviser to the president and first daughter ivanka trump later retweeted it, adding the word: ""taken!"". ""take the red pill"" is a line from the popular 1999 movie ""the matrix"" about seeking the unvarnished truth: ""you take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. you take the red pill, you stay in wonderland and i show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes."". more recently, it's been slang for people abandoning the ways of liberalism for the values of conservatism. people of all ages and ethnicities posted online videos describing ""red pill moments"" - personal awakenings that have caused them to reject leftist narratives imbibed since childhood from friends, teachers, and the news and entertainment media. click here for full coronavirus coverage. musk has been vocally critical of government shutdown policies during the global pandemic recently, reopening tesla's california plant in defiance of local restrictions there last week. tesla's factory reopened monday with musk practically daring local law enforcement to arrest him. the plant apparently continued operations on tuesday. officials backed off wednesday and announced that the move would be okay, as long as the company followed previously agreed-upon worker safety precautions. tesla had a plan to maintain worker safety, including wearing gloves and masks, installing barriers between workers and maintaining social distancing, executives said. the company also reportedly agreed to check workers' temperatures before they entered the facility. tesla's workers have not had a union. musk, whose company had sued alameda county to try overturning the order, also threatened to move tesla's facility out of the state. the plant in fremont, a city of more than 230,000 people southeast of san francisco, had been closed since march 23. it has employed about 10,000 workers. many public health experts have credited the stay-at-home orders with slowing the spread of novel coronavirus, helping hospitals handle the influx of cases. alameda county was among six san francisco bay area counties that were the first in the nation to impose stay-at-home orders in mid-march.",2

"elon musk assists sheryl crow after tesla screen goes black, singer says she's stuck in parking lot. after struggling to turn on her tesla on wednesday, singer sheryl crow turned to her nearly 320,000 twitter followers for assistance. one follower, in particular, rushed in to save the day. ""help! who knows what to do when your @tesla screen goes black and the reset doesn't work? return it and get your money back??"" asked crow, revealing that she was stuck in a parking lot. more than 5,600 fans replied to crow's tweet and submitted dozens of suggestions - but no one's expertise on the subject compared to tesla's own ceo elon musk. elon musk's security clearance is under review. musk responded with simple instructions, ""change your screen preference from night mode to auto."". ""night mode with 0% brightness is actually too dark during the day,"" he added. ""this is ultimately our fault. we will update our software so that 0% brightness is always usable relative to ambient conditions."". a twitter user then pointed out to musk that a reset should have fixed the problem, however. musk said he ""agreed"" that should have been the case. the 57-year-old country crooner thanked musk, giving him a thumbs-up for his help. ""problem solved with that solution after getting to @tesla. might i suggest adding some screen controls to the app so that you're not stuck when the screen goes black?"" crow wrote to musk. she later confirmed to her followers that her issue was resolved and thanked everyone for jumping in to offer suggestions. jimmy buffett's old 1972 chevrolet el camino ss is for sale and ready for a road trip to margaritaville.

""hahahahaha this is amazing! bet you didn't think elon was going to respond directly!"" another user wrote. ""this is like the peak of customer service,"" a follower observed. musk is currently under fire for allegedly violating an agreement with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (sec) when he tweeted about tesla's vehicle production in february without a lawyer's approval. a federal judge will hear oral arguments thursday about whether musk should be held in contempt of court. musk has said his tweet didn't need pre-approval because it wasn't new information that would be meaningful to investors. his attorneys say the sec is violating his first amendment rights to free speech. tesla's shares were falling 9 percent in early trading after the company said it churned out 77,100 vehicles in the first quarter, well behind the pace it must sustain to fulfill musk's pledge to manufacture 500,000 cars annually. as of wednesday's close, tesla shares were down 12.3 percent so far this year. the associated press contributed to this report.",0
"ntsb to probe fiery tesla crash in california. a u.s. agency said tuesday it has sent investigators to look into a fatal crash and fire on a california highway that involved a tesla electric suv equipped with a semi-autonomous control system. the national transportation safety board said on twitter that it's not clear whether the tesla model x was operating on its autopilot program at the time of the crash. the feature is designed to keep a vehicle centered in its lane at a set distance from cars in front of it and also can change lanes and brake automatically. the driver of the tesla, a 38-year-old man from san mateo, california, was killed in the crash last week on u.s. 101 in silicon valley, california highway patrol spokesman art montiel said. photographs taken of the suv show the front of the vehicle was obliterated. its hood was ripped off and its front wheels were strewn on the freeway. the vehicle was traveling southbound at ""freeway speed"" when it hit a freeway barrier, causing a collision with two other cars whose drivers were not reported injured, montiel said. ""for unknown reasons the tesla caught fire,"" montiel said. palo alto, california-based tesla motors wouldn't say if autopilot was working at the time of the crash. it said in a statement tuesday that it was deeply saddened by the crash and is cooperating with authorities. the investigation is the latest by federal authorities into a crash involving a tesla vehicle. in january, the ntsb and the national highway traffic safety administration dispatched teams to culver city, near los angeles, to investigate the crash of a model s electric car that may have been operating under the autopilot system. that crash remains under investigation. the investigations come as congress and federal agencies grapple with how to regulate autonomous vehicles and those with systems that are partially self-driving. tesla has taken steps to prevent drivers from using autopilot improperly, including measuring the amount of torque applied to the steering wheel and sending visual and audio warnings. if the warnings are ignored, drivers would be prevented from using autopilot, the company said.",0
"elon musk says he wants new tesla roadster to hover. elon musk wants tesla's new sports car to make 007 proud. the billionaire electric-car tycoon said he's working on tricking out the forthcoming tesla roadster with rocket technology so it can hover above the ground.

""i thought like maybe we could make it hover but, like, not too high, so like maybe it can hover like a meter above the ground or something like that,"" he added. ""if you plummet, you blow out the suspension but you're not gonna die."". tesla has been working on an updated version of the roadster - the company's first mass-market electric car - for several years. the silicon valley company expects to finish engineering the model this year and hopes to start shipping it in 2022, according to musk. the roadster would be able to move through the air while floating above the ground if musk's hovering experiments are successful, he said. he claimed tesla will offer a ""spacex option package,"" apparently named for musk's rocket company, that will equip the car with a highly pressurized fuel vessel and ""a bunch of thrusters."". tesla named most-satisfying brand. if the hovering doesn't work out, the roadster could still have rear thrusters that would make it ""move like a bat out of hell"" on the road, musk said. ""at minimum i'm confident we could do a thruster where the license plate flips down, you know, james bond-style, and then the rocket thruster behind it, and that gives you three tons of thrust,"" he said. tesla first unveiled the new roadster in 2017. the following year, spacex launched musk's personal roadster into space. the car passed mars for the first time last fall.",0

""the q1 delivery count was impacted by severe model x supplier parts shortages in january and february that lasted much longer than initially expected,"" tesla explained. admitting that model x production got mucked up by fancy features including its ""falcon-wing"" doors, also tesla blamed the shortfall on ""insufficient supplier capability"" and ""tesla not having broad enough internal capability to manufacture the parts in-house."". only a half-dozen out of 8,000 unique parts in the model x were missing, tesla said, ""nonetheless, missing even one part means a car cannot be delivered."". on the bright side, tesla reiterated it is on track to deliver 80,000 to 90,000 new vehicles in 2016, up from 50,580 in 2015. delivery rates ""improved dramatically"" once tesla got the parts, and it cranked out 750 model x's during the last week of march. tesla added that it will ""ensure that these mistakes are not repeated with the model 3 launch."". pre-orders for the model 3 - which require a refundable deposit of $1,000 - were ahead of total 2015 sales of audi (202,000) as well as gm's cadillac and buick lines (175,000 and 223,000, respectively). that's also more cars than ford sold in the us during the entire month of december (237,600), not to mention toyota (238,000) and honda (150,000). more from the new york post.",0
"tesla motors unveils leasing program.. tesla motors ceo elon musk on the automaker's new leasing option for the model s. to structure leases that allow consumers to put the value of federal and state electric-car tax credits, which range from $7,500 to $15,000, toward the cost of a down payment. the palo alto, calif., company said the financing deal, which combines elements of a five-year loan and a three-year lease, would allow customers with good credit to put 10% down on a tesla model s sedan that costs about $80,000 and drive it for about $1,199 a month out of pocket for up to 66 months. tesla shares fell 2.3% in after-hours trading after closing up 41 cents at $44.34 in 4 p.m. trading on the nasdaq stock market. the stock is up more than $6 since its march 28 close. like established luxury-car brands, tesla's plan would take back its cars at the end of the lease. it is guaranteeing model s customers they'll receive a trade-in value equivalent to that of a mercedes-benz s-class sedan. the company said its chief executive elon musk ""is personally standing behind that guarantee to give customers absolute peace of mind about the value of the asset they are purchasing."". tesla's lease caps several days of anticipation touched off when mr. musk tweeted last week that he had a ""really exciting @tesla announcement coming"" and that he was ""going to put my money where my mouth is in v[ery] major way."". what customers would pay out of pocket will vary considerably based on their financial circumstances. a calculator on tesla's website indicates that avoided gasoline costs and business tax deductions would lower the $1,199 monthly cost for its more expensive model, with a 265-mile government certified range, to about $543 a month. that figure includes about $100 a month from not going to a gas station to fill up, time tesla values at $100 an hour. mr. musk, in an interview, said that tesla's less expensive model, with a 208-mile range, could be acquired for an out-of-pocket monthly payment of about $500 if the customer could take business tax deductions for the car. read more about tesla's leasing program from the wall street journal.",0

(ntsb). the preliminary report issued by national transportation safety board (ntsb) on thursday says that data collected from the car indicates that huang had been using the semi-autonomous autopilot feature for 18 minutes and 55 seconds prior to the accident. autopilot can steer and brake itself under certain circumstances, but requires drivers to periodically touch the steering wheel to indicate that they are paying attention. (ntsb). in the 60 seconds leading up to the crash, huang did this on three occasions covering a total of 34 seconds, but was not touching it during the six seconds before impact. the final point corroborates a statement tesla made a week after the accident. huang's car was set to a speed of 75 mph in a 65 mph zone, but had slowed down because there was a vehicle in front of it. seven seconds before the crash, the tesla started to steer toward the gore area between the main highway lanes and the exit for sh-85, accelerating from 62 mph to 70.8 mph as the lead vehicle was no longer in front of it. it hit the divider at that speed without braking or making any evasive steering maneuvers, according to the ntsb report. bystanders removed huang from the car before its battery pack caught fire, and he was transported to a nearby hospital where he died later from his injuries. two other vehicles were damaged in the incident, with one driver suffering minor injuries. the investigation is ongoing and could lead to the ntsb issuing new safety recommendations aimed at preventing similar accidents. tesla has not yet commented on the ntsb report.",0

(tesla). tesla has also announced that it is switching to an all-online sales model, and will be closing many of its stores while increasing investment in its delivery and service system. it said that customers will be able to purchase a car via a phone in about one minute and that they'll be able to return them for a full refund after driving them for up to seven days and 1,000 miles. musk said the move to online sales was necessary to reduce the company's costs enough for it to offer the $35,000 car. it is also reintroducing a two-wheel-drive version of the long range model 3, which was put on hiatus last year, for $43,000 and is pushing out a software update to increase the previously sold cars from 310 miles to the new limit of 325 miles per charge. this is a developing story. check back for updates.",0
"cheapest tesla gets $1,000 price increase after less than a week. (tesla). tesla has raised the price on its cheapest car just 5 days after announcing the $45,000 model. the ""mid-range"" model 3, with rear-wheel-drive and a 260-mile range, is now being advertised for $46,000 on the company's website. the $46,000 model 3 features a lower-capacity battery pack than the long-range version and rear-wheel-drive.
      (tesla). tesla hasn't explained the reasoning behind the adjustment but issued a statement to the electrek blog that said orders already placed at the $45,000 price would be honored. along with the increase on the mid-range model 3, tesla lowered the starting price of the long-range all-wheel-drive model 3 by $1,000 to $53,000, while the launch of a long-promised $35,000 entry level car is still four to six months away. elon musk also announced on tuesday plans to eliminate ""many"" of the interior configurations for the more expensive model s and model x vehicles in an effort to streamline production. more tesla news.",0
"consumer report drops tesla model 3 recommendation due to reliability issues. consumer reports is no longer recommending the tesla model 3 after receiving a large number of complaints from its members about the electric sedan's reliability. issues reported by a group of over 500 model 3 owners included problems with paint and trim quality, faulty infotainment system displays and glass defects. consumer reports said that the car it purchased for testing exhibited the last of those when a crack appeared in its rear window. the downgrade comes less than a month after consumer reports members named the model 3 the most satisfying car to own. tesla model 3 price cut again, now starts at $42,900. ""in most cases, reliability issues will undermine satisfaction,"" said jake fisher, senior director of auto testing at consumer reports. ""but when a vehicle has an enthusiastic following, like with tesla, owners may overlook some issues. we've seen this with other vehicles such as the jeep wrangler and chevrolet corvette."". in response to the report, a tesla spokesperson told consumer reports that ""the vast majority of these issues have already been corrected through design and manufacturing improvements, and we are already seeing a significant improvement in our field data. we take feedback from our customers very seriously and quickly implement improvements any time we hear about issues."". along with the model 3, consumer report also does not recommend tesla's model s or model x, due in part to reliability issues.",2
"tesla cybertruck pickup revealed with bulletproof body and $39,900 starting price. it's a vehicle dreamed up seven years ago that was designed to look like it's from the future. tesla ceo elon musk first tweeted the idea for a ""supertruck"" in 2012 and it became a reality thursday when he unveiled the tesla cybertruck at spacex headquarters in hawthorne, calif. (tesla). musk told the audience of invited guests and media at the event that fox news was denied access to that ""trucks have been the same for a very long time, we wanted to try something different."". (tesla). the electric pickup's unconventional style features sci-fi-inspired elements that include an angular body with slab sides and a windshield that stretches from a peak above the driver's head to a full-width headlight bar in a continuous plane, without a conventional hood. a similar flat surface slopes rearward to the top of the tailgate and incorporates a retractable cover for the bed. (tesla). musk said the truck's body is constructed with a dent and scratch-resistant high strength stainless steel ""exoskeleton"" that was demonstrated by someone hitting it with a sledgehammer without damaging it, along with photos showing its ability to stop a 9mm bullet. the truck's so-called tesla armor glass didn't fare as well and shattered when a small metal ball was thrown at it on stage. (tesla). the cybertruck will be offered in three versions, starting with a $39,900 entry-level model that has rear-wheel-drive, a 250-mile per-charge range, 7,500-pound tow rating and a 0-60 mph acceleration time of 6.5 seconds. a $49,900 dual motor all-wheel-drive model increases the range to 300 miles, the tow rating to 10,000 pounds and reduces the 0-60 mph time to 4.5 seconds. at the top of the lineup is a $69,900 tri motor all-wheel-drive model with twin rear electric motors that can go 500 miles, tow 14,000 pounds, accelerate to 60 mph in 2.9 seconds and cover a quarter-mile in a supercar-quick 10.8 seconds. (tesla). all cybertrucks will be equipped with tesla's autopilot driving aid and the hardware needed to activate the tesla's full self-driving system, which remains a work in progress. they will also come standard with a computer-controlled air suspension system that can lower the vehicle for entry and highway driving and raise it to give it 16 inches of ground clearance for off-roading. (tesla). the pickup features a six-passenger interior with a central front jump seat and a minimalist dashboard that has hidden vents and a 17-inch central display. a front trunk resides beneath a hatch while tesla refers to the bed as a ""vault"" that secures its contents under a retractable cover. the tailgate has an extendable ramp that can be used to ride an atv or other wheeled vehicles aboard. (tesla). tesla is now taking reservations for the cybertruck with a $100 deposit and deliveries of the rear-wheel-drive and dual-motor versions are expected to begin in late 2021 at a yet-to-be-revealed location. competing electric pickup startups rivian and lordstown motors expect to have their first trucks on sale by the end of 2020, and just prior to the tesla event, general motors ceo mary barra confirmed that gm will begin building one of its own at the same time the cybertruck is scheduled to go into production. tesla's consumer website says the tri motor cybertruck will be added in late 2022. .",0
"feds banning sale of autopilot buddy device that enables hands-free tesla operation. (autopilot buddy). the national highway traffic safety association (nhtsa) is cracking down on a device that was designed to trick tesla's semi-autonomous autopilot feature into thinking a driver is paying attention, in order to extend the amount of time that it will operate without anyone touching the steering wheel. nhtsa announced on tuesday that it has sent a cease and desist letter to the makers of autopilot buddy, and has given the company until june 29 to end sales and distribution of the $199 product. the device is a two-piece weighted hoop with magnets that wraps around a steering wheel spoke and registers with the car's sensors as a hand on the wheel. autopilot is programmed to disengage after a short period of time if the driver is not touching the wheel and ignores a series of alerts to take control. the feature was active during at least two fatal car crashes in the united states where the driver did not have his hands on the wheel at the time of a collision. ""a product intended to circumvent motor vehicle safety and driver attentiveness is unacceptable,"" nhtsa deputy administrator heidi king wrote in a press release. ""by preventing the safety system from warning the driver to return their hands to the wheel, this product disables an important safeguard, and could put customers and other road users at risk."". the company behind autopilot buddy, dolder, falco and reese partners llc, is partly owned by motorcycle endurance rider carl reese, who has complained on twitter about the frequency of the ""nags"" that the autopilot subjects drivers to. the autopilot buddy website has a disclaimer posted on it that says the product it is ""for track use only"" and includes an informed consent clause that says that customers agree to not hold the company liable for any accidents, but that hasn't swayed nhtsa. dolder, falco and reese partners llc have not yet commented on the nhtsa action.",0

"tesla set on autopilot slams into michigan state police car. a tesla driver with a suspended license using his car's autopilot feature slammed into a michigan state police car parked on the side of a highway early monday morning. the agency tweeted that the trooper was responding to an accident involving a car and a deer on i-96 in eaton county and had the patrol car's emergency lights illuminated. the tesla model y struck the driver's side rear corner of the police car damaging both vehicles. no one was injured in the incident, but the 22-year-old driver was cited with violating the state's move over law and driving with a suspended license. autopilot is a system that is capable of steering a tesla within a highway lane while controlling its speed, according to the automaker. in detroit on monday, a tesla model y crashed into the trailer of a semi-truck in what was initially suspected to be another autopilot incident, but police later said they didn't think the feature was being used, fox 2 wjbk reported. however, the detroit police and national highway traffic safety administration are continuing investigations into the accident to determine if the technology was involved.",2
"utah woman sues tesla over 'autopilot' crash. the woman who was behind the wheel of a tesla that crashed into a fire truck at high speeds in south jordan is suing tesla and a service provider, saying the autopilot feature failed to work as advertised. according to a lawsuit filed tuesday, heather p. lommatzsch is suing tesla inc., tesla motors utah inc, and service king paint & body over the crash, which occurred in may of this year. the lawsuit alleges negligence and breach of warranty on the part of tesla and negligence on the part of service king, stating that the vehicle's autopilot mode failed to stop the vehicle before it crashed into the back of a unified fire authority fire truck at a high rate of speed. the fire truck was stopped in traffic on bangerter highway when the crash occurred. the lawsuit states the autopilot did not engage in time to prevent the crash and further claims that lommatzsch ""attempted to brake but the brakes did not engage."". the lawsuit states service king replaced a sensor on the vehicle sometime in the year leading up to the crash. the woman suffered injuries in the crash, the lawsuit states, and she is seeking damages in the amount of at least $300,000 to cover both economic and non-economic damages. the lawsuit claims the woman was led to believe the vehicle would stop automatically if an obstacle appeared in the roadway while the autopilot mode was engaged. shortly after the crash, south jordan police stated that data released by tesla technicians indicated the driver had repeatedly engaged, canceled and then re-engaged the vehicle's autosteer and traffic aware cruise control functions. the report also stated the woman had taken her hands off the car's steering wheel more than a dozen times, which tesla claims drivers are advised not to do while using the autopilot system. ""each time she put her hands back on the wheel, she took them back off the wheel after a few seconds,"" tesla's report, as released by south jordan police department, said. ""about 1 minute and 22 seconds before the crash, she re-enabled autosteer and cruise control, and then, within two seconds, took her hands off the steering wheel again. she did not touch the steering wheel for the next 80 seconds until the crash happened; this is consistent with her admission that she was looking at her phone at the time."". a report from the crash indicates the tesla hit the fire truck at about 60 mph and that the driver braked ""fractions of a second"" prior to the crash. tesla released the following statement to fox 13:.

"tesla rear-ends bus in germany, driver blames autopilot.. tesla model s (tesla). but tesla says the autopilot was not at fault. ratzeburg police say that the crash happened wednesday afternoon on a stretch of autobahn about 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of hamburg. the tesla driver was slightly injured. police said in a statement thursday that the 50-year-old tesla driver told officers he had used the autopilot. it wasn't immediately clear whether police had themselves confirmed the autopilot's use, and calls to the ratzeburg police precinct weren't answered late thursday. a tesla spokeswoman in palo alto, california, said thursday the autopilot system was on and functioned properly in the incident, based on conversations the company had with the driver and authorities. the system could not have prevented the crash because the bus swerved into the tesla driver's lane while the tesla was next to the bus, the company said. tesla updated the autopilot software this month following a deadly crash in may. in that crash, a driver using the system was killed when his model s sedan struck a tractor-trailer in florida.",2
"feds examine how tesla autopilot reacts to crossing traffic.. file - in this 2015 file photo provided by his neighbor, krista kitchen, joshua brown stands by his new tesla electric car near his home in canton, ohio. (krista kitchen via ap, file). the national highway traffic safety administration on tuesday posted a nine-page letter seeking information from tesla about autopilot and why it failed to detect a tractor-trailer that crossed in front of a model s sedan may 7 in williston, florida. much of the letter seeks information on how the system works at intersections with crossing traffic, but it also asks tesla to describe how the system detects ""compromised or degraded"" signals from cameras and other sensors and how such problems are communicated to drivers. the crash in williston killed former navy seal joshua brown, 40, of canton, ohio. tesla, which collects data from its cars via the internet, says the cameras on brown's model s sedan failed to distinguish the white side of a turning tractor-trailer from a brightly lit sky and the car didn't automatically brake. the safety agency also asked tesla for its reconstruction of the brown crash, and for details of all known crashes, consumer complaints and lawsuits filed or settled because the autopilot system didn't brake as expected. nhtsa said tesla must comply with its request by aug. 26 or face penalties of up to $21,000 per day, to a maximum of $105 million. a spokesman said the agency hasn't determined if a safety defect exists with autopilot. the information request is a routine step in an investigation, spokesman bryan thomas said. tesla's autopilot system uses cameras, radar and computers to detect objects and automatically brake if the car is about to hit something. it also can steer the car to keep it centered in its lane. the company says that before autopilot can be used, drivers must acknowledge that it's an ""assist feature"" that requires both hands on the wheel at all times. drivers also must be prepared to take over at any time, tesla has said. tesla released autopilot last fall. some safety advocates have questioned whether the company - which says the system is still in ""beta"" phase, a computer industry term for software testing by customers - and nhtsa allowed the public access to the system too soon. ""no safety-significant system should ever use consumers as test drivers on the highways,"" said clarence ditlow, head of the nonprofit center for automotive safety. he said nhtsa lacks the electronic engineers and laboratories needed to keep up with advanced technology such as general motors air bags or tesla's autopilot. tesla says autopilot has been safely used in over 100 million miles of driving by customers and that data shows drivers who use autopilot are safer than those who don't. nhtsa's thomas said he won't comment on specifics of the investigation. the agency does not currently have legal authority to prevent automakers from rolling out features if they meet basic federal motor vehicle safety standards. it is in the process of developing standards for self-driving cars. the nhtsa letter came as tesla disclosed that a second crash occurred while at least part of the autopilot system was operating. a driver who was heading from seattle to yellowstone national park told a state trooper that his tesla model x suv was on autopilot when it crashed early saturday on a rural two-lane road in montana, the state's highway patrol said. but tesla said the driver activated autosteer, one of the autopilot features, and no force was detected on the steering wheel for more than two minutes. if there's no force on the wheel or a sharp turn is detected, the vehicle is programmed to gradually reduce speed, stop and turn on the emergency lights, tesla said in a statement. the company said the model x alerted the driver to put his hands on the wheel, but he didn't do it. ""as road conditions became increasingly uncertain, the vehicle again alerted the driver to put his hands on the wheel. he did not do so and shortly thereafter the vehicle collided with a post on the edge of the roadway,"" the statement said. it wasn't clear whether the model x had made a decision to stop at the time of the crash. neither the driver nor the passenger was injured in the single-vehicle crash, but there was extensive damage to the passenger side and the car lost a wheel, montana highway patrol trooper jade shope said. the car negotiated a right curve and went off the road, traveling about 200 feet on the narrow shoulder, taking out 13 posts, shope said. the trooper did not cite the driver, saying he believed any citation would be voided because of the driver's claim that the car was on autopilot. the nhtsa investigation, opened june 28, could have broad implications for the auto industry and its path toward self-driving cars. if the probe finds defects with tesla's system, the agency could seek a recall. other automakers have or are developing similar systems that may need to be changed due to the probe, which also could affect self-driving car regulations to be unveiled this summer. in the letter, nhtsa also asked tesla for details on any modification to the autopilot system that tesla has made.",0
"tesla semi truck has 200 to 300-mile range, insider says.. tesla semi teaser image (tesla). that's according to ryder chief technology and procurement officer scott perry, who told reuters he met with tesla earlier this year and was informed that the battery-powered big rig the company is set to reveal in september will likely be a day cab with a range of 200-300 miles per charge. that technically makes it a long-haul truck, but comes nowhere near the 1,000-1,500 mile range some diesel powered tractors can cover between fill-ups. this suggests tesla is initially targeting the regional trucking market, which accounts for about one-third of the industry. but while tesla shared the details of this type of truck with perry, he thinks other options could be on the way. ""i'm not going to count them out for having a strategy for longer distances or ranges, but right out of the gate i think that's where they'll start,"" he said. tesla wouldn't comment on the report. tesla isn't the only company getting into the electric trucking business. toyota is currently testing a hydrogen fuel cell-powered electric semi that has a range of about 200 miles between fill-ups. it's hauling cargo between the ports of long beach and long angeles, along with the 16,000 diesel-powered trucks that service the ports. meanwhile, a new company in utah called nikola motors claims to have 7,000 orders for the hydrogen-powered semi it has in development, which has an expected range of 1,200 miles. as far as ryder is concerned, perry didn't say if the company has committed to buying any of tesla's trucks, but it did just ink a deal with california-based startup chanje to lease, rent and service is china-made battery-powered delivery vans, which have a range of up to 100 miles. toyota's electric semi is quick as lightning:.",0
"consumer groups, 'sully' sullenberger raise concerns about tesla's autopilot and full self-driving features. two consumer advocacy groups on thursday refiled a request with the federal trade commission for it to investigate tesla's representation of its autopilot driver aid system, calling it ""misleading"" and ""deceptive."". the center for auto safety and consumer watchdog submitted a letter to the ftc last year on the same topic, but a spokesperson for the latter said that they never received a response, so it is unclear if the agency has taken any action. an ftc spokesman told fox news autos that it could not publically comment on such requests. the groups also sent the updated letter to the attorneys general california, new york, florida, michigan, utah, and massachusetts. according to tesla's website, autopilot ""enables your car to steer, accelerate and brake automatically for other vehicles and pedestrians within its lane."". in the letter, the groups maintain that there have been several accidents linked to misuse of the feature since they last reached out to the ftc and cite a recent survey conducted by the insurance institute for highway safety (iihs) that found many car owners don't fully understand the capabilities of their vehicle's driver assist systems, including tesla's autopilot. tesla would not comment on the groups' requests to the ftc, but issued the following statement regarding the iihs report:. ""this survey is not representative of the perceptions of tesla owners or people who have experience using autopilot, and it would be inaccurate to suggest as much. if iihs is opposed to the name 'autopilot,' presumably they are equally opposed to the name 'automobile.'"" the statement added that the automaker provides owners with guidance on how to use the feature properly and that autopilot deactivates if the vehicle determines the driver is no longer engaged. on the same day that the groups announced their ftc request, safety expert capt. chesley ""sully"" sullenberger shared a washington post article about tesla's evolving ""full self-driving"" feature on twitter with the comment that it ""should concern everyone who will share the same streets as a driver or pedestrian,"" which prompted a debate on the topic in the tweet's comment stream. full self-driving is an option that currently enables a tesla to change lanes, pass other cars and perform several other maneuvers with minimal driver interaction. however, the company advertises on its website that it will be able to recognize and respond to traffic lights and stop signs, and also provide ""automatic driving on city streets"" later this year. tesla ceo elon musk has also said that its self-driving capabilities may be ""feature complete"" by the end of 2019 and that fully-autonomous operation without supervision could be possible as early as next year, regulations permitting. tesla would not comment on the tweet, while representatives for sullenberger have not responded to a request for him to elaborate on his statement.",2
"tesla's latest features are for criminals and dogs.
