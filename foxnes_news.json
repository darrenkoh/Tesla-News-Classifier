(note: most electric cars, like teslas, don't technically use gears or transmissions, but the terms remain in use when describing their operation.). the model s and x are also being advertised with a yoke-style steering wheel, but according to a redditor who claims to have been in the new model s, they are currently being shipped with a traditional round wheel until nhtsa approves the yoke, at which time owners will be able to get it retrofitted into their new cars. tesla has not officially confirmed the status of the wheel.",

(tesla). only a few photos have been revealed, which appear to show touchpad thumb controls on the left wheel spoke for the turn signals and more for the windshield wiper and horn on the right. ferrari currently employs large wheel-mounted buttons to operate the turn signals, but tesla's take is unique. (ferrari). \"tesla's history makes it no surprise when they announce new safety features as if they were easily reversible updates to a cell phone instead of controls to a multi-ton vehicle,\" said jason levine, executive director of the center for auto safety. \"while it may be possible to safely design a new steering wheel we look forward to hearing the conclusion of nhtsa's inquiry as to whether that's what tesla has done here.\". (tesla). the tesla model 3 and y use a conventional steering wheel with stalks, but the controls for their windshield wipers are split between a button on the left stalk that provides a single wipe or cleaning spray and wipe when it is held down, while the touchscreen display is used to turn them on fully and adjust their speed. there's also a rain-sensing automatic function available which is listed a beta feature in development. . tesla also provides voice commands for many systems and the new wheel design could be a reflection of that, along with the company's promise of providing full autonomous driving capability by the end of 2021. nhtsa recently updated its regulations to allow autonomous cars to be built without any steering wheel or pedals, but only if they are primarily designed to be operated without a human driver. (tesla). the new wheel is equipped in the updated model s and mode x, which have just entered production, while prototypes for the upcoming cybertruck and roadster featured a similar design. elon musk elaborated on twitter how the car works without a stalk for a transmission selector saying \"car guesses drive direction based on what obstacles it sees, context & nav map. you can override on touchscreen.\". he added that: \"after you drive without using a prnd stalk/stick for a few days, it gets very annoying to go back & use a shifter!\". nhtsa recently urged tesla to recall 158,000 vehicles due to potential touchscreen failure because several vital safety systems require the display to operate. this story has been updated with musk's comments.",

(toyota). \"i think we'll probably make an international version of cybertruck that'll be kind of smaller, kind of like a tight wolverine package,\" musk said. but what exactly did he mean by \"tight wolverine package?\" tesla did not respond to a request from fox news for comment, nor has it for any story since aug. 2019, but we have some ideas. (nikola motors). one of the cybertruck's possible competitors is the badger pickup that general motors has agreed to build for startup nikola motors, a company named after the same person as tesla. similarly, both the wolverine and badger belong to the mustelidae animal family of carnivores. in the dog eat dog of the car business, however, tesla is the alpha of the pair. nikola has yet to build any production trucks and the recent departure of its founder, trevor milton, under allegations of fraud by an outside investor has made its future murky. (343 industries). musk has previously said that the sci-fi-style cybertruck was inspired by video games like halo, which includes the m12 warthog fast attack vehicle. but the united nations space command has plenty of other futuristic military vehicles at its disposal, including the m9 main anti-aircraft tank, aka: the warthog. however, the 25-foot long surface-to-air missile-equipped half-track is bigger than the 19' 4\" cybertruck, so that's probably not it. in the real world, the u.s. military has a gigantic bridge layer called the wolverine that's even larger than the halo vehicle, but there's a much older military truck that might be closer to what musk has in mind. istock/rweisswald. the m151 was first built by ford for the u.s. military in 1959 as a successor to the willys mb and mc, but was customized and modernized in 1975 by a specialty vehicle fabrication company in florida and sold under the wolverine name. at just about 11 feet long, it's perhaps too small for tesla's requirement, but turn it into a four-door and put a bed on it and you practically end up with a jeep gladiator-sized midsize truck. perfect. (classic car studio). classic car studio owner noah alexander, who recently handled one for a client, told fox news autos that records about warthog production have largely disappeared, but from what he was able to dig up, they were apparently built in small quantities for both military and civilian use, with most having been shipped to foreign countries. could one of them have made its way to musk's boyhood home of pretoria, south africa, and imprinted itself in his mind as an iconically cool truck? technically speaking, it's possible. the yamaha wolverine isn't a truck, but it is a popular line of side-by-sides, also known as utility task vehicles or utvs. this is the most likely candidate for what musk was thinking about, because tesla has experience with the brand ... unofficially. the electric cyberquad it debuted with the cybertruck last november was later discovered to be converted yamaha 700 raptor atv that the powersports company said it didn't have any involvement with.

(tesla). musk said the $139,990 model s plaid will have three electric motors producing a combined 1,100 hp and will be capable of reaching 60 mph in less than two seconds and covering a quarter-mile in under nine seconds. a prototype of the sedan has already completed a lap of california's 2.2-mile long laguna seca racetrack in 1:30.3 seconds and musk said they are aiming to reduce that time by three seconds, which would give it the record for production vehicles, currently held by the mclaren senna supercar at 1:27.62. (tesla). the name and design of the inexpensive model were not revealed, but musk suggested it would use the new batteries and an architecture that incorporates the cells into the car's structure, rather than installing them as a separate pack. he likened it to turning the wings of an airplane into fuel tanks and said it reduces weight while increases the strength of the vehicle. in 2018, musk also predicted that tesla would be able to build a $25,000 car within three years.

            "body": "alameda county gives elon musk's tesla ok to reopen california factory. it appears the dispute between tesla and san francisco bay area authorities over the reopening of a factory in the face of shutdown orders is coming to an end. the alameda county public health department announced on twitter early wednesday that the fremont, calif., plant will be able to go beyond basic operations this week and start making vehicles this coming monday - as long as it delivers on the worker safety precautions that it agreed to. (ap). it wasn't clear from a press release whether tesla would face any punishment for reopening monday in defiance of county orders. messages were left early wednesday seeking comment from health officials and tesla. the release said fremont police would verify whether tesla was holding up its part of the agreement. the release says that public health indicators have to remain stable or improve for the factory to stay open. \"we will be working with the fremont pd to verify tesla is adhering to physical distancing and that agreed upon health and safety measures are in place for the safety of their workers as they prepare for full production,\" the release said. tesla's factory reopened monday with musk practically daring local authorities to arrest him and operations apparently continued into tuesday. the company met a monday deadline to submit a site-specific plan to protect worker safety. but the reopening defied orders from the health department, which has deemed the factory a nonessential business that can't fully open under restrictions intended to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. the health department said monday it warned the company was operating in violation of the county health order, and hoped tesla will \"comply without further enforcement measures\" until the county approves a site-specific plan required by the state. state law allows a fine of up to $1,000 a day or up to 90 days in jail for operating in violation of health orders. the plant in fremont, a city of more than 230,000 people south of san francisco, had been closed since march 23. it employs about 10,000 workers. public health experts have credited the stay-home orders with slowing the spread of novel coronavirus, helping hospitals handle an influx of cases. the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. but it has killed more than 80,000 people in the u.s., with the death toll rising. alameda county was among six san francisco bay area counties that were the first in the nation to impose stay-at-home orders in mid-march. gov. gavin newsom has repeatedly said that counties can impose restrictions that are more stringent than state orders. the order in the bay area has been extended until the end of the month, but the counties plan to allow some limited business and manufacturing starting may 18, the same day detroit automakers plan to reopen auto assembly plants. some auto parts plants were to restart production this week. the detroit automakers' 150,000 u.s. workers are represented by the united auto workers union, which has negotiated for added safety precautions. tesla's workers do not have a union. . musk, whose company has sued alameda county seeking to overturn its order, threatened to move tesla's manufacturing operations and headquarters from the state. tesla contends in the lawsuit that alameda county can't be more restrictive than orders from newsom. the lawsuit says the governor's coronavirus restrictions refer to federal guidelines classifying vehicle manufacturing as essential businesses that are allowed to continue operating. tesla relesed a plan to maintain worker safety, including the wearing of gloves and masks, installing barriers between workers and maintaining social distancing. haggerty said the company initially pushed back on checking employee temperatures before boarding a company bus to get to work. but tesla relented, he said, and agreed to check workers.",

(yasin ozturk/anadolu agency via getty images). musk has long expressed skepticism about the coronavirus, which has sickened more than 3.1 million people and killed more than 217,000 people worldwide, according to a johns hopkins university tally. wednesday's outburst was his most explicit yet, however, and came as tesla eked out a first-quarter profit of $1.24 a share, surprising wall street, which had been expecting a loss of 36 cents a share. that marked the company's third consecutive quarterly profit, sending the stock up more than 7 percent in extended trading. \"if somebody wants to stay in their house, that's great,\" musk said. \"but saying they can't leave their house and that they will be arrested if they do - that's fascist.\". he raged that the lockdowns will cause \"great harm\" to many companies, and that not all companies will be able to weather an extended shutdown as well as tesla. . indeed, despite the shutdowns that have slammed the brakes on restaurants, factories and travel, tesla reported $5.99 billion in revenue, narrowly beating out analyst estimates of $5.90 billion. revenue grew 32 percent year-over-year even with tesla temporarily having shut down production at its fremont, calif., factory, as well as its shanghai gigafactory, because of the coronavirus pandemic. still, the silicon valley auto maker said it's too soon to say how the rest of the year might be affected by the spread of covid-19, which has shuttered production as public officials ordered non-essential workers to shelter in place. \"it is difficult to predict how quickly vehicle manufacturing and its global supply chain will return to prior levels,\" the company said. \"due to the wide range of potential outcomes, near-term guidance of net income and free cash flow would likely be inaccurate. we will again revisit our 2020 guidance in our q2 update.\". the south africa-born executive's expletive-filled outburst echoes protests in several states urging officials to lift lockdown measures that have forced businesses to close and put millions of workers on the unemployment rolls. president trump recently voiced support for the largely conservative protesters by calling on officials to \"liberate\" minnesota, michigan and virginia. his lashing out kicked off with a tweetstorm in the wee hours of wednesday morning. \"free america now,\" musk tweeted at 2:15 a.m. wednesday to his more than 33 million twitter followers. \"give people their freedom back!\" he wrote in sharing a sunday op-ed in the wall street journal arguing that severe shutdowns have not helped save many lives. tesla shares rose 7.7 percent, to $861.78, after hours. click here for more from the new york post.",

            "body": "new tesla feature slows for red and green lights. after testing on public roads, tesla is rolling out a new feature of its partially automated driving system designed to spot stop signs and traffic signals. the update of the electric car company's cruise control and auto-steer systems is a step toward ceo elon musk's pledge to convert cars to fully self-driving vehicles later this year. but it also runs contrary to recommendations from the u.s. national transportation safety board that include limiting where tesla's autopilot driving system can operate because it has failed to spot and react to hazards in at least three fatal crashes. in a note sent to a group of tesla owners who were picked to test the stop light and sign recognition feature, the company said it can be used with the traffic aware cruise control or autosteer systems. the feature will slow the car whenever it detects a traffic light, including those that are green or blinking yellow. it will notify the driver of its intent to slow down and stop, and drivers must push down the gear selector and press the accelerator pedal to confirm that it's safe to proceed. the company warns in the note obtained by the associated press that drivers must pay attention and be ready to take immediate action \"including braking because this feature may not stop for all traffic controls.\". the note says that over time, as the system learns from the fleet on the roads, it \"will control more naturally.\". tesla didn't respond to multiple requests for additional details, but the website electrek.co reported last week that the new feature is being sent to the wider tesla fleet as part of an over-the-internet software update for thousands of vehicles. the feature won't come until later in other parts of the world, the website said. the national highway traffic safety administration, the u.s. government's road safety agency, said in a prepared statement monday that the agency \"will closely monitor the performance of this technology,\" adding that drivers must be ready to act and law enforcement agencies will hold them responsible. elon musk says the cybertruck can float. jason levine, executive director of the center for auto safety, a nonprofit watchdog group, said tesla is using the feature to sell cars and get media attention, even though it might not work. \"unfortunately, we'll find out the hard way,\" he said. whenever one of its vehicles using autopilot is involved in a crash, tesla points to \"legalese\" warning drivers that they have to pay attention, levine said. but he said tesla drivers have a history over-relying on the company's electronics. missy cummings, a robotics and human factors professor at duke university, fears that a tesla will fail to stop for a traffic light and a driver won't be paying attention. she also said tesla is using its customers for \"free testing\" of new software. she also fears that the cars will stop for green lights and their drivers won't react in time to keep moving, causing more rear-end collisions. the ntsb has ruled in three fatal crashes that tesla's autopilot system was partly to blame, and it has expressed frustration with nhtsa for failing to act on the board's recommendations. last month the board, which has no regulatory powers, took the unusual step of accusing nhtsa of contributing to the cause of a march 2019 tesla crash in florida. the march 1, 2019, crash in delray beach, florida, killed the 50-year-old driver of a tesla model 3. the car was traveling 69 miles per hour (111 kilometers per hour) when neither the driver nor the autopilot system braked or tried to avoid a tractor-trailer that was crossing in its path. the car struck the trailer, which sheared off the tesla's roof. the report also blamed the truck and the tesla driver in the crash. ntsb chairman robert sumwalt said in march that the crash was the third \"where a driver's overreliance on tesla's autopilot and the operational design of tesla's autopilot have led to tragic consequences.\". nhtsa said it will review the ntsb's report. the delray beach crash was remarkably similar to one in 2016 in williston, florida, which also killed a tesla driver. in that crash neither autopilot nor the driver stopped for a crossing tractor-trailer. tesla maintains that its vehicles operating on autopilot are about twice as safe as those in which the system isn't engaged. the company says in the fourth quarter, drivers using autopilot had one crash for every 3.07 million miles driven. .",

            "body": "ntsb faults drivers, tesla and regulations in final 'autopilot' crash reports. the national transportation safety board says two drivers, tesla and lax regulation of new partially automated driving systems are to blame for a fatal 2019 crash in florida involving a tesla on autopilot. (ntsb). the ntsb, in a report issued thursday, said the design of the autopilot system contributed to the crash because it allowed the tesla driver to avoid paying attention. tesla also failed to limit where autopilot can be used, allowing drivers to activate it in areas it wasn't designed for, the report said. the board, which investigates crashes and makes safety recommendations, also took the unusual step of accusing the government's national highway traffic safety administration of contributing to the crash. the agency failed to make sure automakers put safeguards in place to limit use of electronic driving systems to areas where they are designed to work, the report said. the report was another case of sparring between the two federal agencies over regulating new electronic driver-assist technology, which nhtsa so far has been reluctant to do. the march 1, 2019, crash in delray beach, florida, killed the 50-year-old driver of a tesla model 3. the car was traveling 69 miles per hour (111 kilometers per hour) when neither the driver nor the autopilot system braked or tried to avoid a tractor-trailer that was crossing in its path on u.s. 441 around 6:17 a.m. the car struck the trailer, whose driver the report cited for turning in front of the tesla. the trailer sheared off the tesla's roof. the truck driver was not hurt. . \"the delray beach investigation marks the third fatal vehicle crash we have investigated where a driver's overreliance on tesla's autopilot and the operational design of tesla's autopilot have led to tragic consequences,\" ntsb chairman robert sumwalt said in a statement. at a hearing last month on a california fatal crash, board members were frustrated that safety recommendations from previous tesla autopilot crashes had been ignored by tesla, and that nhtsa has not taken action on its recommendations. nhtsa referred to a previous statement that it will review the ntsb's report and that all commercially available vehicles require human drivers to stay in control at all times. the delray beach crash was remarkably similar to one in 2016 in williston, florida, which also killed a tesla driver. in the delray beach crash, the driver turned on the car's adaptive cruise control system, which keeps it a set distance from vehicles of ahead of it, 12.3 seconds before impact, the ntsb found. autosteer, which keeps the car centered in its lane, was turned on 2.4 seconds later. no pressure was detected on the steering wheel in the 7.7 seconds before the crash, the report said. tesla told the ntsb that the driver wasn't warned about not having his hands on the wheel \"because the approximate 8-second duration was too short to trigger a warning under the circumstances,\" the report said. the ntsb's report said autopilot wasn't designed to work in areas with cross traffic, yet tesla allows drivers to use it under those circumstances. tesla told the ntsb that forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking systems on the model 3 in the delray beach crash weren't designed to activate for crossing traffic or to prevent crashes at high speeds. \"according to tesla, the autopilot vision system did not consistently detect and track the truck as an object or threat as it crossed the path of the car,\" the report said. a message was left thursday seeking comment from tesla, which warns in owners manuals that autopilot is designed for use on limited access highways with no cross traffic. the company also says autopilot is a driver-assist system and that drivers must be ready to intervene at all times.",

            "body": "ntsb: tesla driver was playing video game at time of fatal crash, new safety measures needed for driver assist systems. the national transportation safety board (ntsb) says the driver of a tesla suv who died in a silicon valley crash two years ago was playing a video game on his smartphone while his vehicle was being controlled by a partially automated driving system. (ntsb). chairman robert sumwalt said at the start of a hearing tuesday that systems like tesla's autopilot cannot drive themselves, yet drivers continue to use them without paying attention. \"if you own a car with partial automation, you do not own a self-driving car,\" sumwalt said in opening statements. \"this means that when driving in the supposed 'self-driving' mode, you can't read a book, you can't watch a movie or tv show, you can't text and you can't play video games.\". the board will determine a cause of the crash at the hearing and make recommendations to prevent it from happening again. sumwalt says government regulators have ignored the board's previous recommendations for measures to prevent these crashes. tesla owner complained about autopilot before fatal crash. the march 2018 crash involving a tesla model x suv killed apple engineer walter huang when it swerved and slammed into a concrete barrier dividing freeway and exit lanes in mountain view, calif. just before the crash, the tesla steered to the left into a paved area between the freeway travel lanes and an exit ramp, the ntsb said. it accelerated to 71 mph and crashed into the end of the concrete barrier. the car's forward collision avoidance system didn't alert huang, and its automatic emergency braking did not activate, the ntsb said. also, huang did not brake, and there was no steering movement detected to avoid the crash, the board's staff said. ntsb investigators previously found that tesla's system became confused at a freeway exit and was a factor in the crash. documents released earlier this month quoted huang's relatives as saying huang had previously complained about autopilot malfunctioning and swerving in the area near where crash occurred. autopilot is designed to keep a vehicle in its lane and keep a safe distance from vehicles in front of it. it also can change lanes with driver approval. tesla says autopilot is intended to be used for driver assistance and that drivers must be ready to intervene at all times. nhtsa looking into tesla unintended acceleration complaints. ntsb staff determined that tesla's system does not adequately make sure drivers are paying attention and recommended that stronger driver monitoring systems be required. sumwalt said the board had made recommendations to six automakers in 2017 to stop the problem and only tesla has failed to respond. teslas can sense a driver applying force to the steering wheel, and if that doesn't happen, it will issue visual and audio warnings. but monitoring steering wheel torque, \"is a poor surrogate measure\" of monitoring the driver, ensar becic, the ntsb's human performance and automation highway safety expert told the board. messages were left tuesday afternoon seeking comment from tesla. under questioning from board members, robert molloy, the ntsb's director of highway safety, said the national highway traffic safety administration is taking a hands-off approach to regulating new automated driving systems like autopilot. molloy called the approach \"misguided,\" and said nothing is more disappointing than seeing recommendations ignored by tesla and nhtsa. the ntsb can only make recommendations, while nhtsa is the agency charged with making regulations. \"they need to do more,\" he said of the federal highway safety agency. more tesla news. nhtsa has told the ntsb it has investigations open into 14 tesla crashes and would use its enforcement of safety defects to take action if needed. the agency issued a statement saying it will review the ntsb's report and that all commercially available vehicles require human drivers to stay in control at all times. \"distraction-affected crashes are a major concern, including those involving advanced driver assistance features,\" the statement said. sumwalt said the ntsb had called for technology more than nine years ago to disable distracting functions of smartphones while the user is driving, but no action has been taken. . don karol, the ntsb's project manager for highway safety, told the board that the staff is recommending that cell phone companies program phones to automatically lock out distracting functions such as games and phone calls while someone is driving. the staff also recommends that companies enact policies to prevent use of company issued cell phones while workers are driving. \"lockout mechanisms should be default setting and should automatically lock out distracting functions,\" karol told the board. tesla has said autopilot was put out initially in \"beta,\" meaning it was being tested and improved as bugs were identified, karol told the board. that brought a response from vice chairman bruce landsburg, who said if the system has known bugs, \"it's probably pretty foreseeable that somebody's going to have a problem with it. and then they (tesla) come back and say 'oh, we warned you.'\".",

(ntsb). the complaints were detailed in a trove of documents released tuesday by the u.s. national transportation safety board, which is investigating the march 2018 crash that killed engineer walter huang. the documents say huang told his wife that autopilot had previously veered his suv toward the same barrier on u.s. 101 near mountain view, calif. where he later crashed. huang died at a hospital from his injuries. \"walter said the car would veer toward the barrier in the mornings when he went to work,\" the huang family's attorney wrote in a response to ntsb questions. huang also described autopilot's malfunctioning to his brother, the attorney wrote, in addition to talking with a friend who owns a model x. huang, a software engineer, discussed with the friend how a patch to the autopilot software affected its performance and made the model x veer, the lawyer's response said. sometime prior to the crash, huang took his tesla to a service center to fix a \"navigation error,\" the attorney's response said. but tesla could not duplicate the problem and it was not repaired. the huang family is suing tesla and california's department of transportation for allegedly failing to maintain the highway. autopilot is a partially automated system designed to keep a vehicle in its lane and keep a safe distance from vehicles in front of it. it also can change lanes with driver approval. tesla says autopilot is intended for driver assistance and that drivers must be ready to intervene at all times. the full ntsb board is scheduled to hold a hearing on the crash on feb. 25. at that time, it will determine a cause and make safety recommendations. ntsb staff members have already recommended that california transportation officials move faster to repair highway safety barriers damaged by vehicles. a report from the agency says california officials failed to fix the barrier that was damaged in a crash 11 days before huang was killed. in that incident, a 2010 toyota prius traveling in excess of 75 mph (120 kmh) crashed against the attenuator, a cushion that protects vehicles from hitting the end of concrete lane dividers. the 31-year-old driver survived the crash and was treated for relatively minor injuries, the ntsb said. . the california highway patrol responded to the march 12 crash but did not notify the california department of transportation of the damage as it is required to, the ntsb said. huang's 2017 tesla model x was traveling at 71 mph (114 kph) when it crashed against the same attenuator, which the ntsb determined had been damaged and repaired more frequently than any other left-exit in caltrans' district 4, which includes all of the san francisco bay area, a region of 7 million people. in the three years before the tesla crash, the device was struck at least five times, including one crash that resulted in fatalities. a car struck it again on may 20, 2018, about two months after the tesla crash, the ntsb said. california department of transportation spokesman matt rocco said the department is reviewing the ntsb report to determine its next steps but declined to answer questions. \"safety remains caltrans top priority,\" he said. also on tuesday, the ntsb released documents from another fatal tesla crash, this one on march 1, 2019 in delray beach, florida. in that incident, driver jeremy banner turned on the autopilot function of his model 3 sedan 10 seconds before the crash, then took his hands off the steering wheel, ntsb documents said. the car then drove underneath a tractor-trailer that was crossing in front of it, sheering off the car's roof and killing banner. it was eerily similar to another florida crash in 2016 in which a tesla on autopilot went beneath a semi-trailer. nhtsa looking into tesla unintended acceleration complaints. the ntsb said in a preliminary report that it still hasn't determined the cause of the crash. according to the report, traffic was light on the four-lane highway and dawn was breaking when banner, 50, set his speed at 69 mph (111 kph) and activated the autopilot as he headed to work. the speed limit was 55 mph (88 kph). seconds later, a tractor-trailer driven by richard wood, 45, pulled from a driveway and began to cross to the other side of the highway. wood said he saw two sets of car headlights coming toward him, but he thought he had time to make it across. \"it was dark and it looked like the cars was back further than they was,\" wood told ntsb investigators four days after the crash. a photo taken by the ntsb from tesla's front-end video camera showed wood's trailer fully blocking the road 1.5 seconds before the crash. data from the tesla's computer shows that banner hit his brakes less than a second before the crash, but the car went under the trailer. wood says he saw a second car but that one didn't hit the trailer. palm beach county firefighters who arrived minutes later found the tesla about a quarter-mile (400 meters) down the highway with its engine running. the car had automatically shifted to neutral and turned on its emergency flashers when its computer detected the crash. they said that they had never dealt with a tesla's ignition before and didn't know how to turn it off - that requires using a keycard. the department has since given its firefighters additional training.",

(tesla). tesla's cybertruck may have gotten the headlines this year, but the model y trucklet will be the next new model it puts on sale. the compact utility vehicle is based on the model 3 sedan and equipped with a battery pack that's good for 300 miles per charge in the $48,000 long range rear-wheel-drive version that will be the most affordable model y when it enters production mid-year. rivian r1t. (rivian). startup electric truck company rivian raised nearly $3 billion from the likes of amazon, ford, cox automotive and t. rowe price in 2019 and is set to launch its first battery-powered pickup by the end of 2020. the luxurious midsize r1t has a starting price of $69,000 and comes with an adjustable air suspension system, four-motor all-wheel-drive and the ability to spin in place like a tank. top models will offer 400 miles of range, 750 hp, 0-60 mph acceleration in 3.0 seconds and a max tow rating of 11,000 pounds. .",

(wsvn). \"during that operation, modules that had separated from the battery ignited on the tow truck when workers passed a chain over them,\" the ntsb report stated. the fires extinguished by themselves, but when the car was loaded onto a different truck, the battery caught fire again and had to be put out by the fire department. when the battery and modules were being unloaded at the tow yard, the case and modules reignited once again, but the fire burned itself out, according to the report. (ntsb). the youths were returning from a trip to a nearby mall when the crash occurred on a road with a 30 mph speed limit and a sign warning drivers to go 25 mph around the curve, the report said. the tesla was going 116 mph. the driver lost control while passing another vehicle, according to the report. the high-performance version of the model s hit a curb and a wall, and the battery caught fire, it said. the driver was given the car at the end of 2017, and got a ticket in march of 2018 for driving it 112 mph on a road with a 50 mph speed limit, according to the report. (ntsb). after the ticket, the youth's father stopped him from driving the car and asked tesla if it could restrict the car's speed. employees at a tesla store put the vehicle into \"loaner\" mode, limiting it to 85 mph. but in april ,tesla restored the car to normal speed mode at the request of the teen, who was able to make service decisions on the car, the report stated. batteries like those used by tesla and other electric cars can catch fire and burn rapidly in a crash, although tesla has said its vehicles catch fire far less often than those powered by gasoline. .",

(ap). vernon unsworth, who participated in the rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach trapped for weeks in a thailand cave last year, had sought $190 million in damages for the shame and humiliation caused by the man his lawyer called a \"billionaire bully.\". it took less than an hour for an eight-person jury in los angeles federal court to reject unsworth's claim after a four-day trial. musk said the verdict restored his faith in humanity as he quickly left the court with his security detail. musk - who deleted the tweet and later apologized for it - had asserted the expression was nothing more than a flippant insult that meant \"creepy old man,\" not pedophile. unsworth had provoked the attack by belittling musk's contribution to the rescue -- a miniature sub his engineers built that was never used -- as ineffective and nothing more than a \"pr stunt.\" he further earned the ire of the tech whiz by suggesting musk stick the sub \"where it hurts.\". on friday, it was unsworth who felt the pain. \"i accept the jury verdict, take it on the chin, and move on,\" unsworth said outside court. jury foreman joshua jones said the panel decided unsworth's lawyers failed to prove their case. he said they spent too much time trying to appeal to jurors' emotions and not concentrating on the evidence. \"the failure probably happened because they didn't focus on the tweets,\" jones said after the verdict was announced. \"i think they tried to get our emotions involved in it.\". attorney lin wood, in an impassioned and at times emotional closing argument, suggested the jury should award $190 million. wood said $150 million of that figure should be a \"hard slap on the wrist\" to punish musk for what he said was akin to dropping an atomic weapon on his client that would create problems for years like radioactive fallout. he suggested the figure would be reasonable given that musk testified his stock in tesla and spacex is worth about $20 billion. but musk's lawyer, alex spiro, ridiculed the suggested verdict as \"numbers being thrown out like 'the price is right.'\". wood said it was important to challenge musk's tweet in court even if they didn't win. unsworth had said the statement would appear true if he didn't sue. \"anybody that knows this man knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that elon's accusations were false,\" wood said outside court. \"this was not the justice that he deserved under the evidence.\". while musk was cleared of liability, the trial was just the latest incident where he's faced legal problems because of troublesome tweets. musk and tesla reached a $40 million settlement with the securities and exchange commission last year over allegations he misled investors with a tweet declaring he had secured financing to buy out the electric car maker. earlier this year, the sec sought to hold him in contempt of court for tweeting a misleading projection of how many cars tesla would manufacture. that led to a new agreement imposing tight controls on musk's tweets about the company. the day after musk's tweet about unsworth, tesla stock price fell 3% and shareholders and people within the company were urging him to apologize. musk said he resisted at first because he didn't want to look \"foolish and craven\" by doing so right after the stock dropped. musk's lawyer told the jury the tweet did not rise to the level of defamation and cases over insults didn't belong in federal courtrooms. spiro said unsworth had tried to profit off his role in the cave rescue and basked in the many accolades he received. unsworth had been honored by the queen of england and the king of thailand, had his photo taken next to british prime minister theresa may and been asked to speak at schools and contribute to a children's book, which showed that no one took musk's insult seriously. \"people accused of pedophilia don't get celebrated by world leaders,\" spiro said. \"kings and queens and prime ministers don't stand next to pedophiles.\". unsworth hadn't demonstrated actual damage to his reputation other than asserting over a couple minutes of emotional testimony delivered with his voice cracking that he felt isolated, ashamed and dirtied, spiro said. there was no supporting testimony from his girlfriend or other friends who could discuss the impact they witnessed, no evidence he had lost business or relationships as a result of the tweet and he hadn't sought psychological counseling or medication. spiro mocked unsworth's claims that the tweet was like a life sentence without parole, noting that many people are serving such terms in actual prisons. he urged jurors to return a verdict that would make clear no reasonable person would conclude musk had called him a pedophile. \"tell mr. unsworth once and for all, 'you are not a pedophile,' \" spiro said. \"with our verdict, we free you, we free you from parole.\". .",

(ap). the tesla ceo returns to the witness stand wednesday after spending several hours at his defamation trial trying to dance around the meaning of the \"pedo guy\" tweet he aimed at vernon unsworth, a cave diver who helped rescue a dozen boys and their soccer coach from a flooded thailand cave last year. musk said the insult meant only \"creepy old man\" and did not literally mean he was calling unsworth a pedophile. the spat began when unsworth ridiculed musk's effort in the rescue by having engineers at his companies, including space x and the boring co., develop a mini-submarine that could transport the boys to safety. despite working around the clock to build the sub in short order, musk arrived in thailand late in the rescue effort and the craft was never used. unsworth called it nothing more than a \"pr stunt\" and said musk could stick the sub \"where it hurts.\" musk watched the cnn clip of unsworth several times before lashing out in a series of tweets july 15, 2018. (ap). \"it was wrong and insulting, so i insulted him back,\" the billionaire told a los angeles federal court jury. \"it was an unprovoked attack on what was a good-natured attempt to help the kids.\". unsworth is seeking unspecified damages for pain, suffering and emotional distress from the tech entrepreneur whose net worth exceeds $20 billion. musk's lawyer, alex spiro, said during opening statements that unsworth deserves nothing for what he called \"joking, taunting tweets in a fight between men.\". the shame and mortification unsworth said he experienced is undercut by the attention he received after the rescue, spiro said, including honors from the thai king and british prime minister and offers from agents and film crews. musk, who was dressed in a charcoal gray suit and white shirt, remained composed on the witness stand during questioning from unsworth's lawyer, who called him as his first witness. his answers were at times humorous and sometimes seemed like those of an executive under court order to be careful about what he says. unsworth, left, was present at the trial.\n      (ap). musk is required to have his tweets about tesla screened as part of court settlement with the securities and exchange commission over allegations he posted misleading information about the company that caused wild stock swings. his tweet about unsworth caused tesla's stock to drop about 3% the following day, though it recovered a day later. after company officials tried to get musk to apologize for the tweet, he responded in an email that he didn't want look \"foolish and craven\" by doing so right after the stock dropped. musk projected an air of humility as he was asked about his influence in the world. he said he didn't think his efforts to address climate change were taken seriously, that few people were aware of his goal to colonize mars and he didn't really pay attention to how his fortune stacks up against other billionaires. with his arms crossed, musk at times squinted and stared off in the distance as he searched for answers to events that occurred more than a year ago. he clashed at one point with attorney l. lin wood, telling him he interpreted the lawyer's letter threatening to sue as a shakedown and extortion attempt. \"i get these shakedown letters a lot,\" musk said. \"i think you're looking for a significant payday.\". spiro attempted to humanize musk, having him discuss his family - sets of 15-year-old twins and 13-year-old triplets, all boys. musk choked up talking about a son who died as a baby and when asked about his childhood in south africa. \"it wasn't good,\" he said after a long pause. musk said he was asked to help with the cave rescue and decided to get involved when he heard a thai navy diver died in the cave system and that a monsoon was forecast that could drown the soccer team. musk received no compensation for his efforts, though he acknowledged his work could have been interpreted as a \"narcissistic\" publicity effort. musk deleted the july 15, 2018, tweets and apologized on twitter, though subsequent statements he made have called into question what he meant. musk responded to a question on twitter about whether he had accused unsworth of being a pedophile by saying, \"bet ya a signed dollar it's true.\". he told a buzzfeed reporter seeking comment on the threat of a lawsuit by unsworth to \"stop defending child rapists,\" followed by expletives. musk was asked about an almost comical attempt to dig up dirt on unsworth when it became clear he could be sued. one of his executives created a fake email account to communicate with a man who said he was an investigator, but then signed his own name on a nondisclosure agreement. the investigator turned out to be a con man who was paid $52,000 and produced nothing damning about unsworth. musk said he didn't know unsworth had helped with the rescue when he first tweeted about him and said \"pedo guy\" wasn't asserted as a fact. \"just as i didn't literally mean he was a pedophile, i'm sure he didn't literally mean shoving a sub up my ass,\" musk testified, provoking snickers. when asked about the final line of his email to the buzzfeed reporter that said he hoped unsworth would sue him, musk quipped: \"i guess be careful what you wish for.\". .",

(tesla). the cybertruck will be offered in three versions, starting with a $39,900 entry-level model that has rear-wheel-drive, a 250-mile per-charge range, 7,500-pound tow rating and a 0-60 mph acceleration time of 6.5 seconds. a $49,900 dual motor all-wheel-drive model increases the range to 300 miles, the tow rating to 10,000 pounds and reduces the 0-60 mph time to 4.5 seconds. at the top of the lineup is a $69,900 tri motor all-wheel-drive model with twin rear electric motors that can go 500 miles, tow 14,000 pounds, accelerate to 60 mph in 2.9 seconds and cover a quarter-mile in a supercar-quick 10.8 seconds. (tesla). all cybertrucks will be equipped with tesla's autopilot driving aid and the hardware needed to activate the tesla's full self-driving system, which remains a work in progress. they will also come standard with a computer-controlled air suspension system that can lower the vehicle for entry and highway driving and raise it to give it 16 inches of ground clearance for off-roading. (tesla). the pickup features a six-passenger interior with a central front jump seat and a minimalist dashboard that has hidden vents and a 17-inch central display. a front trunk resides beneath a hatch while tesla refers to the bed as a \"vault\" that secures its contents under a retractable cover. the tailgate has an extendable ramp that can be used to ride an atv or other wheeled vehicles aboard. (tesla). tesla is now taking reservations for the cybertruck with a $100 deposit and deliveries of the rear-wheel-drive and dual-motor versions are expected to begin in late 2021 at a yet-to-be-revealed location. competing electric pickup startups rivian and lordstown motors expect to have their first trucks on sale by the end of 2020, and just prior to the tesla event, general motors ceo mary barra confirmed that gm will begin building one of its own at the same time the cybertruck is scheduled to go into production. tesla's consumer website says the tri motor cybertruck will be added in late 2022. .",

(cybrtrk owners club). the forum may have previously discovered a stick drawing of the vehicle hidden in its trademarked logo, the letters of which can be moved around to create an outline of a truck that looks very much like what the teaser composite illustrates. see more from the cybrtrk owners club. the truck's styling will be confirmed when it rolls onto the stage at spacex headquarters in hawthorne, calif. technical details are still secret, but musk has said it is aimed at delivering both the pickup capabilities of a ford f-150 and the performance of a porsche 911 and could have a base price of $49,000 when it goes on sale, likely not before 2021. .",

(fox news autos). unlike earlier editions, the latest software release allows drivers to give the car blanket authorization to make the lane changing maneuvers without requiring human approval before each one, although tesla says that the driver is still expected to pay attention and prove this by touching the steering wheel. \"navigate on autopilot is based on map data, fleet data, and data from the vehicle's sensors. however, it is the driver's responsibility to remain in control of the car at all times, including safely executing lane changes,\" the automaker told consumer reports. porn star shoots adult film in moving tesla on autopilot. consumer reports determined that some maneuvers the car made would be considered illegal in connecticut, where the organization is based. \"in essence, the system does the easy stuff, but the human needs to intervene when things get more complicated,\" said jake fisher, the organization's head of automotive testing. \"this isn't a convenience at all,\" fisher added. \"monitoring the system is much harder than just changing lanes yourself. using the system is like monitoring a kid behind the wheel for the very first time. as any parent knows, it's far more convenient and less stressful to simply drive yourself.\". \"our team consistently reviews data from instances when drivers took over while the feature has been in use, and has found that when used properly both versions of navigate on autopilot offer comparable levels of safety,\" tesla wrote in a recent blog. \"tesla is showing what not to do on the path toward self-driving cars: release increasingly automated driving systems that aren't vetted properly,\" said david friedman, a former acting administrator of the national highway traffic safety administration who now is vice president of advocacy at consumer reports. the associated press contributed to this report.",

            "body": "ntsb: tesla autopilot was engaged before fatal florida crash. a tesla model 3 involved in a fatal crash with a semitrailer in florida march 1 was operating on the company's semi-autonomous autopilot system, federal investigators have determined. the car drove beneath the trailer, killing the driver, in a crash that is strikingly similar to one that happened on the other side of florida in 2016 that also involved use of autopilot. (ntsb). in both cases, neither the driver nor the autopilot system stopped for the trailers, and the roofs of the cars were sheared off. the delray beach crash, which remains under investigation by the national transportation safety board and the national highway traffic safety administration, raises questions about the effectiveness of autopilot, which uses cameras, long-range radar and computers to detect objects in front of the cars to avoid collisions. the system also can keep a car in its lane, change lanes and navigate freeway interchanges. tesla has maintained that the system is designed only to assist drivers, who must pay attention at all times and be ready to intervene. in a preliminary report on the march 1 crash, the ntsb said that initial data and video from the tesla show that the driver turned on autopilot about 10 seconds before the crash on a divided highway with turn lanes in the median. from less than eight seconds until the time of the crash, the driver's hands were not detected on the steering wheel, the ntsb report stated. tesla model 3 test drive. neither the data nor the videos indicated the driver or the autopilot system braked or tried to avoid the trailer, the report stated. the model 3 was going 68 miles per hour when it hit the trailer on u.s. 441, and the speed limit was 55 mph, the report said. jeremy beren banner, 50, was killed. tesla said in a statement thursday that banner did not use autopilot at any other time during the drive before the crash. vehicle logs show that he took his hands off the steering wheel immediately after activating autopilot, the statement said. tesla also said it's saddened by the crash and that drivers have traveled more than 1 billion miles while using autopilot. \"when used properly by an attentive driver who is prepared to take control at all times, drivers supported by autopilot are safer than those operating without assistance,\" the company said. porn shot in tesla on autopilot:. the circumstances of the delray beach crash are much like one that occurred in may 2016 near gainesville, florida. joshua brown, 40, of canton, ohio, was traveling in a tesla model s on a divided highway and using the autopilot system when he was killed. neither brown nor the car braked for a tractor-trailer, which had turned left in front of the tesla and was crossing its path. brown's tesla also went beneath the trailer and its roof was sheared off. after that crash tesla ceo elon musk said the company made changes in its system so radar would play more of a role in detecting objects. david friedman, who was acting head of nhtsa in 2014 and is now vice president of advocacy for consumer reports, said he was surprised the agency didn't declare autopilot defective after the gainesville crash and seek a recall. the delray beach crash, he said, reinforces that autopilot is being allowed to operate in situations it cannot handle safely. \"their system cannot literally see the broad side of an 18-wheeler on the highway,\" friedman said. tesla's system was too slow to warn the driver to pay attention, unlike systems that consumer reports has tested from general motors and other companies, friedman said. gm's super cruise driver assist system only operates on divided highways with no median turn lanes, he said. tesla needs a better system to more quickly detect whether drivers are paying attention and warn them if they are not, friedman said, adding that some owners tend to rely on the system too much. \"tesla has for too long been using human drivers as guinea pigs. this is tragically what happens,\" he said. to force a recall, nhtsa must do an investigation and show that the way a vehicle is designed is outside of industry standards. \"there are multiple systems out on the roads right now that take over some level of steering and speed control, but there's only one of them that we keep hearing about where people are dying or getting into crashes. that kind of stands out,\" friedman said. nhtsa said thursday that its investigation is continuing and its findings will be made public when it's completed. the delray beach crash casts doubt on musk's statement that tesla will have fully self-driving vehicles on the roads sometime next year. musk said last month that tesla had developed a powerful computer that could use artificial intelligence to safely navigate the roads with the same camera and radar sensors that are now on tesla cars. \"show me the data,\" friedman said. \"tesla is long on big claims and short on proof. they're literally showing how not to do it by rushing technology out.\". in a 2017 report on the gainesville crash, the ntsb wrote that design limitations of autopilot played a major role. the agency said that tesla told model s owners that autopilot should be used only on limited-access highways, primarily interstates. the report said that despite upgrades to the system, tesla did not incorporate protections against use of the system on other types of roads. the ntsb found that the model s cameras and radar weren't capable of detecting a vehicle turning into its path. rather, the systems are designed to detect vehicles they are following to prevent rear-end collisions.",

            "body": "musk: it's 'insane' not to buy a tesla. robotaxis coming next year. tesla ceo elon musk expects to start converting the company's electric cars into fully self-driving vehicles next year as part of an audacious plan to create a network of robotic taxis to compete against uber and other ride-hailing services. the vision sketched out monday during an event at tesla's silicon valley headquarters requires several leaps of faith - something that the zealous investors and consumers who view musk as a technological genius often are willing to take. but self-driving car experts fear musk is shirking public safety in an effort to boost tesla's stock and sell more of the company's electric cars. this amid lingering questions about whether the 15-year-old automaker can consistently make money. \"it sounds like a pipe dream that he's selling people,\" said raj rajkumar, an electrical and computer engineering professor at carnegie mellon university. \"i think it's basically overpromising, which is typical of elon musk.\". to prove his skeptics wrong, musk will have to persuade regulators that tesla's technology for transforming potentially hundreds of thousands of electric cars into self-driving vehicles will produce robots that are safer and more reliable than humans. fox news autos test drive: tesla model 3. and to do that, musk will have to be correct in his bet that tesla has come up with a better way to produce self-driving cars than virtually every other of the more than 60 companies in the u.s. working toward the same goal. some of those companies are aiming to have their fully autonomous cars begin carrying passengers in small geographic areas as early as this year, but many experts don't believe they'll be in widespread use for a decade or more. unlike most of those other companies, tesla's cars won't come with the light beam sensors called lidar that many industry experts consider to be essential equipment for robotic vehicles to navigate the road. (tesla). musk trashed lidar as a \"fool's errand\" and \"frigging stupid\" in a putdown of companies such as google spin-off waymo and general motors' cruise automation that are including the light beam sensors in their systems. \"they are going to dump lidar,\" musk assured investors and analysts gathered at tesla's palo alto, california, office for the 2 1\u20442 hour presentation. musk, widely known for his swagger as much as his smarts, spent much of the time trying to persuade both the investors and consumers that he had figured out a better way to teach robots how to drive. \"it is fundamentally insane to buy anything other than a tesla,\" musk said at one point, arguing that purchasing a vehicle from any other automaker would be like getting a horse. musk's quasi-sales pitch came two days before tesla is expected to report a disappointing performance for the first three months of the year. analysts polled by factset predict a $305.5 million first quarter net loss based on disappointing car sales, a setback after musk pledged heading into the second half of last year that tesla would be profitable from that point onward. tesla's stock sank by nearly 4 percent to close monday at $262.75. from musk's vantage point, tesla has a huge advantage over autonomous vehicle competitors because it gathers a massive amount of data in the real world. this quarter, he said tesla will have 500,000 vehicles on the road, each equipped with eight cameras, ultrasonic sensors and radar gathering data to help build the company's neural network, which will serve as the digital equivalent of the self-driving cars' consciousness. the network allows vehicles to recognize images, determine what objects are and figure out how to deal with them. to become fully self-driving, the cars also need a special computer that fits behind the glove box and is powered by a special chip musk boasted is better than any other processor in the world \"by a huge margin.\". currently the self-driving computer costs $5,000, but the price rises to $7,000 if it's installed after delivery. finally, tesla will deliver software updates to those computers to make it possible for its electric cars to be driven by a robot, without a human in position to take over in case something goes awry. there will be a slight chance of some \"fender benders,\" musk acknowledged monday, and indicated tesla will be liable for accident caused by a vehicle under the control of its robot. \"people will die,\" rajkumar predicted. \"i can tell you that right now. because in the real world, crazy things happen.\". musk predicted that the technology for fully self-driving tesla will roll out at some point from april to june next year. then, tesla will need to get regulatory approval for the fully autonomous cars to drive on roads, something musk predicted would happen in a few states by the end of next year. he didn't specific where tesla will try to gain approval first. california, tesla's biggest u.s. market, requires proof that fully autonomous cars can drive safely on public roads, but most other states aren't as stringent. and experts say there's no federal law requiring preapproval for fully autonomous driving, as long as a vehicle meets federal safety standards, which teslas already do. within three years, tesla will be manufacturing self-driving cars that don't even have steering wheels or brake pedals in them, musk said. if they're allowed on the roads, fully driverless cars would allow musk to carry out his plan to expand into the ride-hailing market with a fleet of sleek teslas. owners of teslas with the company's self-driving computer could plug into an app-based network to pick up fare-paying passengers when they didn't need to use their vehicle. musk theorizes that a ride-hailing service similar to uber and lyft will boost tesla's revenue and make it easier for the company to sell its cars to consumers who could effectively lower the cost of ownership by making money on the side. tesla would get 20% to 25% of each fare in the network. tesla also intends to convert all the electric cars under leasing contracts to be turned into robotaxis upon their return. uber and lyft also consider driverless cars to be one of the keys to making money from their still unprofitable services, but haven't set a specific timetable for achieving that breakthrough while they continue to work on their own autonomous technology. waymo rolled out a ride-hailing service using self-driving vehicles late last year in the phoenix area, but it only available to a small pool of passengers who were previously enrolled in a test program. and all the cars in waymo's ride-hailing service still have a human behind the steering wheel ready to take control. the waymo cars also have lidar, something experts remain convinced must be part of any fully self-driving car, despite musk's colorful contentions otherwise. \"vehicles that don't have lidar, that don't have advanced radar, that haven't captured a 3-d map are not self-driving vehicles,\" ken washington, ford's chief technical officer, said during a recent interview with recode. \"they are great consumer vehicles with really good driver-assist technology.\".",

            "body": "tesla model 3 test drive: a masterwork ... in progress. of all the cars on sale today, the only one that would qualify as an influencer if it were human would be the tesla model 3. love it. loathe it. it doesn't matter how you feel. there's no other car that's changing the conversation the way that the sleek sedan is. the chevy bolt and nissan leaf? not trending. i recently got around to spending some quality time in a model 3 that i borrowed from a private owner. it wasn't the long-awaited $35,000 model (which folks are still waiting for), but a dual-motor long range with a premium interior and about 6,000 miles on it. all problem-free, according to him. (fox news autos). he said he paid $53,000 for it last year. last week a similar car cost $48,500. today it's $49,500. this is how tesla's direct sales model works. it meets demand with frequent list price adjustments, sometimes dramatic, instead of offering incentives. it differs from industry practice, and is an honest way of doing things, but for loyal customers tracking the resale value of their cars, or wall street investors watching the company, comes across as a bit frenetic. one thing that won't change is the size of the model 3, which is more of a compact 4-door than the midsize elon musk and tesla bill it as. it's not as long and has the same rear legroom as a bmw 3-series, a chief competitor and the quintessential compact. what makes the difference is that the overall interior volume - boosted by a front trunk where an internal combustion engine would usually be - squeezes it over the threshold for a midsize on the epa scale. the driver's seat isn't all the way back in this photo, but set comfortably for the author's 6-foot 1-inch frame.\n      (fox news autos). in reality, if 6-footers are in the front seats, either they are completely comfortable, or no one is. there's nothing wrong with this. some cars are just smaller than others, but if you're buying a model 3 sight unseen, as many do, don't expect a limousine to get dropped off in front of your house on delivery day. (tesla). the cabin is airy, however, thanks to a full panoramic glass roof that's tinted just enough to dim the sunlight to a pleasant level. at least in new york in early spring. even rear seat passengers have the sky above their heads. below them is a synthetic leather that's so supple it feels more like a fabric than a hide. if i could, i would upholster my entire life with it. the front seats are showstoppers that fully live up to the \"premium\" billing and do a lot to distract from the fact that the rest of the cabin trim isn't any nicer that what you find in a mazda these days. (tesla). the minimalist design of the dashboard is visually stunning, however, as it stretches door to door with just a steering wheel to ruin the symmetry. in models with a wood trim, it reminds me of an atari 2600 console. this is an interesting coincidence since the 15-inch touchscreen mounted in the center of it is equipped with several games from the company's archive. the screen is also what you use to control nearly everything in the model 3 and it houses all of its displays, including the speedometer. the positioning is fine, but considering how much real estate is available, some of the text and icons are smaller than necessary. executing simple tasks, like adjusting the steering wheel or climate control, also require more steps than knobs or buttons would and your eyes off the road for too long. the fact that it does so many things is impressive, the ease and speed at which it does some of them less so. (tesla). that's where autopilot comes in. tesla's semi-autonomous driving aid is a countermeasure to distractions, although it can be a bit of one itself. it has an evolving feature set that makes it hard to resist pushing the limits to see what it is capable of when you should be relying on it as backup to your own driving. autopilot can control the speed of the car and steer it within a lane, which it excels at on the highway. as long as it has a bead on things, it's smoother than you would likely be. the slower and windier the road gets, the jerkier its inputs become, but i can see why videos have started popping up of \"sleeping\" tesla drivers, because it lulls you into a sense of confidence in its abilities. if you take your hand off the wheel, it will eventually warn you not to do that and then disengage. tesla hasn't made it clear exactly how long the model 3 can go without any driver input, but i went about a minute before it posted a message on the screen, followed by a flashing light and then an audible alarm as it signed off. if you make it that far, you have to pull over and turn the car off to use autopilot again. if you don't do anything, it's programmed to turn the hazard lights on and bring itself to a stop in the lane. but keep checking in and autopilot will cruise indefinitely. there are mercedes-benzes that can do this, but the tesla does it better. both systems will also change lanes with a flick of the turn signal, but here the mercedes-benz might have the tesla beat. in a couple of instances, when there was a car far behind me in the passing lane, the model 3 couldn't seem to figure out if it should go or not and started doing an unnerving serpentine before making the move. in my experience, mercedes-benz's system is more decisive. soon, you won't have to be in the tesla. it offers a navigate on autopilot feature that can drive the car all the way from on ramp to off ramp on the highway if you have a destination set, merging into traffic, changing lanes and passing other vehicles along the way. initially, it would only suggest the maneuvers and require you to acknowledge them with the turn signal stalk, but there's an update rolling out that that's smarter and allows you to give it blanket prior approval to just go for it whenever it wants to, as long as it senses any sort of \"user\" input, according to musk. the version i tried was a mixed bag. it was seamless most of the time, but often abruptly adjusted its speed in the merging lanes, and once accelerated rapidly directly toward two cars that were far too close for it to fit between them. i didn't wait to see how that was going to pan out and tapped the brakes. negotiating off ramps was both inconsistent and consistent. i used the same exit five times as a control. twice the car asked me to take over before we even arrived at it and on the three other attempts it followed an aggressive line at a speed faster than i would have, but exactly the same one each try. tesla constantly collects data from all of its cars on the road to update how autopilot works, and i got the impression it had developed that specific path from the information, rather than just having the car follow the painted lines. (tesla). autopilot is a work in progress and far from perfect, and my experience suggests that you should resist the urge to convince yourself that it is. people have gotten hurt and worse by doing that. but if you treat it as an assistant, it may save your bacon someday. according to tesla, its data indicates that you're much less likely get into an accident with it turned on. the model 3 is a car you'll want to drive yourself, anyway. and with 310 miles of range that can be replenished to 80 percent in about 40 minutes at the newest supercharger stations, you can do plenty of that. the rear-wheel-drive model was also rated at only 310 when it was new, but an over-the-air software update in the middle of the night a few weeks ago added an extra 15 while also making all model 3s a little faster. the tooth fairy is on notice.tesla's a bit hazy on how much power the model 3 has on tap, but says it will accelerate to 60 mph in under 4.5 seconds. that speed arrives in near silence with all of the immediacy that electric motors are known for. (tesla). the steering is similarly responsive and the model 3 feels solid as a steel brick, despite concerns raised by consumer reports and others about its long-term reliability. its tires are a little stiff for the new york metro area's rutted roads, but the overall blend of ride and handling is superb for car that doesn't have an electronically controlled suspension. turn up the juice in a bend and you'll find that it's tail-happier than a typical all-wheel-drive car, but that's the fun way around one. if not the most reassuring for everyone onboard. the problem with making a final assessment about the model 3 is that it's a constantly moving target. even in the time since i started writing this, tesla altered its model lineup and added a leasing program. one thing is for certain: there's no electric car anywhere near its price range that comes close to competing with it, and a lot of the liquid-fueled ones have trouble, too. follow fox news autos on facebook for more. this story has been updated to clarify the specifications.",

(tesla). tesla said the move was largely due to the fact that the plus has been outselling the standard range by a factor of 6 to 1. limiting the number of battery pack sizes it offers helps streamlines production, and the company has used a similar strategy several times previously to update the model s and x lineups. tesla model y debuts with $39,000 base price. the model y utility vehicle shares a platform with the model 3.\n      (tesla). the base price of the plus has also been increased from $37,500 to $39,500, but it now comes with the semi-autonomous autopilot electronic driving aid, which was a $3,000 option. tesla's release on the changes said that \"all tesla vehicles now come with autopilot bundled as a standard feature,\" but fox news autos has confirmed that the feature is not active on the $35,000 version of the model 3. the rear-wheel-drive long range model 3 has also been removed from the website and joins the standard range model 3 as an off-menu model that must be ordered in-store or on the phone. along with the lineup changes, tesla announced its first leasing program for the model 3, which requires a $3,000 down payment, but does not allow leases to buy their car at the end of the 36-month term. that's because tesla is planning to use them for an autonomous ride-hailing service it expects to have up and running by then, which will also allow owners to hire out their vehicles when they are not using them. elon musk explains reason for tesla model 3's mysterious cockpit camera.",

(tesla). ceo elon musk has previously detailed the long-term goal for such a system, which would theoretically allow owners of fully self-driving teslas to hire them out as taxis when they're not using them for themselves. responding to a twitter question about it from one of his followers, musk revealed that the camera above the rearview mirror is primarily there to keep an eye on passengers using the service and provide evidence if anyone \"messes up\" a car. he added that the cameras can also see out of the windows to provide additional input for other features. eight additional cameras are located around the exterior of the model 3.\n      (tesla). while some have speculated that it could also be used as a monitor to help assure that a driver is watching the road while using the semi-autonomous autopilot system, musk did not suggest that possibility, instead pointing out that owners will have the option of turning it off completely. a recent cnbc report detailed how much unencrypted personal data, including video, is stored onboard a tesla and able to be extracted after an accident if not intentionally wiped clean by the owner. the interior camera is not present on the current versions of the model s or model x. musk said that more information about the ride-hailing scheme and the technology behind it will be released during a webcast on april 22. what are those holes in my dashboard for, anyway?.

            "body": "court gives elon musk, sec two weeks to settle tweet dispute. (ap). a judge on thursday urged stock market regulators and tesla ceo elon musk to amicably settle their dispute over his tweets. if not, she said she'll decide whether to grant regulators' request that the outspoken executive face escalating fines if he breaks rules protecting investors. u.s. district judge alison j. nathan asked how she should punish musk if she finds him in contempt for violating a deal with the securities and exchange commission requiring him to first clear with lawyers tweets that might disclose important company facts. sec attorney cheryl crumpton recommended fines. but at the end of the hearing, nathan ordered both sides to seek a resolution over the next two weeks. \"everybody take a deep breath, put your reasonableness pants on and work this out,\" nathan said. even so, nathan said court-supervised agreements must be obeyed. \"i don't care if you are a small potato or a big fish,\" nathan said as musk, with an estimated worth of $22 billion, sat at a defense table with his lawyers. nathan pressed crumpton during the hearing to define the conditions under which musk should seek approval before he tweets, and drew attention to ambiguity surrounding the rules the sec sought to enforce. musk, who followed the back-and-forth intently with a slight frown and furrowed brow, emerged from the courtroom to say: \"i'm very happy with the result and i'm impressed with judge nathan's analysis.\". legal experts said it makes sense for the two sides to negotiate another settlement rather than to leave the decision to nathan, although they cautioned it's always difficult to predict what the famously mercurial musk will do. \"the big question is whether he will dig in his heels and resist,\" said peter henning, a wayne state university law professor and former sec attorney. \"i get the feeling they will come up with something because musk probably doesn't want to risk being held in contempt of court. that will be like two strikes against him.\". attorney john hueston, representing musk, told the judge the sec had failed to show his client had violated the deal. he said his client was \"somebody trying his best to comply.\". \"he actually does what he is told,\" hueston said. in a statement after the hearing, musk signaled he is willing to work out a deal with regulators. \"we have always felt that we should be able to work through any disagreements directly with the sec, rather than prematurely rushing to court,\" he said. the issue over musk's tweets stems from a settlement reached last year after musk tweeted that he had secured the funding to take tesla private at $420 a share - a substantial premium over the price at the time - when he did not. that tweet, last august, sent the company's stock on a wild ride. the sec says it hurt investors who bought tesla stock after the tweet but before they had accurate information. musk later backed off the idea of taking the company private, but regulators concluded he had not lined up the money to pull off the deal. the sec says musk blatantly violated the settlement in february when he tweeted about tesla's vehicle production without a lawyer's approval. musk's 13-word tweet on feb. 19 said tesla would produce around 500,000 vehicles this year. but the tweet wasn't approved by tesla's \"disclosure counsel,\" and the sec's contempt-of-court motion filed that month said musk had not sought a lawyer's approval for a single tweet. musk said his tweet about car production didn't need pre-approval because it wasn't new information that would be meaningful to investors. his attorneys said the sec was violating his first amendment rights to free speech. much of the debate thursday centered around whether the sec rules provide a clear way to for musk to determine whether or not the information he's about to tweet would be material to investors and, therefore, require preapproval from lawyers. \"this case is like a shot across the bow from the sec,\" said marc leaf, a new york lawyer who formerly worked for the agency and advised on its settlement agreements. \"what they would like tesla's board to do is tell elon, 'you are a genius but your tweets aren't the smartest thing to be doing, so cut it out.'\". but hueston argued further restricting musk's ability to communicate about his company and imposing fines would \"freeze his ability\" to operate as an effective entrepreneur. to support his arguments, hueston cited an earlier exchange between the judge and crumpton in which nathan said she was \"surprised\" that the sec left it up to musk in so many instances whether to run by his lawyers what he intended to put out publicly. \"does he need preapproval?\" the judge asked crumpton at one point. \"we're not saying 'yes' or 'no,'\" she responded. hueston said the sec's first step after the tweet about production should have been to approach tesla in good faith, and nathan agreed. \"the parties should be meeting, conferring and providing some clarity so this issue won't happen again,\" hueston said. the sec says its deal doesn't restrict musk's freedom of speech because as long as his statements are not false or misleading, they would be approved. meanwhile, tesla's shares fell 8% thursday after the company disclosed that both its car manufacturing pace and vehicle delivery rate slowed during the first three months of the year, raising questions about its ability to be consistently profitable. the sec sought to oust musk from his role as chairman and ceo over his august tweet. instead, musk and tesla agreed to pay $40 million and made other concessions to settle the case and ensure musk remained ceo. musk's unpredictable behavior has led some to question whether he should remain in that job, while others say he's a visionary too valuable to lose. last year, musk berated stock market analysts for asking questions about tesla's finances and prompted a defamation lawsuit when he called a diver who helped rescue 12 boys on a thai soccer team from a flooded cave a pedophile.",

(ap). tesla's assembly lines slowed and deliveries fell during a rocky start to the new year that is likely to magnify nagging doubts about the company's ability to post sustained profits. the palo alto, california, company churned out 77,100 vehicles from january to march, well behind the pace it must sustain to fulfill ceo elon musk's pledge to manufacture 500,000 cars annually. the company only delivered 63,000 vehicles in the quarter, down 31% from 2018's fourth quarter. it cited a big increase in vehicle deliveries to europe and china and \"many challenges encountered for the first time.\". the lower-than-expected delivery numbers and \"pricing adjustments\" will take a bite out of tesla's first-quarter net income, it said. but it said it ended the quarter with sufficient cash on hand. tesla said it still expects to deliver between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles this year. the first-quarter production figures announced late wednesday lagged the 86,555 vehicles that tesla manufactured during the final three months of last year when the company was scrambling to make more cars. that push helped tesla post a profit in back-to-back quarters for the first time in its 15-year history. musk has already warned investors that the company will lose money during this year's first quarter amid cost-cutting needed to lower the price of its model 3, its first electric car designed for the mass market. the company produced 62,950 model 3s in this year's first quarter, up 1.6% from 61,934 in the prior three months. musk has acknowledged that tesla's hopes of becoming a consistent moneymaker are riding on the success of the model 3 and a sport utility vehicle called the model y scheduled to be released next year. and for those vehicles to become hits, tesla will have to be able to produce them in high volumes. the company didn't provide further details on how it fared financially during the first quarter. its quarterly results are expected to be released late this month or in early may. tesla attributed the production decline to the cancellation of lower-priced versions of the models s and x, a move the company said was designed to differentiate the more expensive vehicles from the model 3. the lower production figures come amid more uncertainty for a company that seems to be caught in an endless cycle of turmoil. u.s. stock market regulators are accusing musk of improperly tweeting about tesla's manufacturing volume in february when he predicted that the company would make about 500,000 cars this year. a few hours later, he backtracked slightly, saying he meant tesla would be manufacturing about 125,000 cars per quarter by the end of this year, a pace that would translate into 500,000 vehicles annually. either way, the securities and exchange commission alleges musk's tweet violated a court-approved settlement that called for him to have his tweets about tesla information pre-approved by the company. that requirement is part of a $40 million settlement reached last year after musk tweeted he lined up the financing needed to lead a buyout of a tesla, a claim that the sec asserted was a misleading statement that duped investors. musk has vehemently denied his february tweet violated the settlement and is fighting the sec's attempt to have him held in contempt of court. u.s. district judge alison nathan is scheduled to hear further arguments about the case during a hearing scheduled thursday in new york.",

(ap). u.s. securities regulators countered tesla ceo elon musk's contempt-of-court defense monday night, writing in court papers that he brazenly disregarded a federal judge's order and that one of his arguments \"borders on the ridiculous.\". lawyers for the securities and exchange commission, in a response to musk, wrote that when the contempt motion was filed in february, musk had not had a single tweet approved by a company lawyer, violating a requirement of a court-approved settlement order. the october securities fraud settlement stemmed from tweets by musk in august about having the money to take tesla private at $420 per share. but musk didn't have the funding secured. tesla and musk each had to pay $20 million in fines and agree to governance changes that included musk's removal as chairman. sec lawyers led by cheryl crumpton wrote in a response to musk's defense that he interprets the settlement order as not requiring pre-approval unless musk decides the tweets are meaningful to investors. the agency said musk's argument that tweeting about car production forecasts on feb. 19 wasn't material information is nearly ridiculous. \"his interpretation is inconsistent with the plain terms of this court's order and renders its pre-approval requirement meaningless,\" the lawyers wrote. u.s. district judge alison nathan in manhattan will decide if musk is in contempt and whether he should be punished. the sec said no hearing is necessary on the matter \"because there appear to be no disputed issues of material fact.\". musk's lawyers wrote last week that the feb. 19 tweet merely restated previously approved disclosures on electric car production volumes. they wrote that the tweet, which was published after the markets closed, neither revealed material information, nor altered the mix of data available to investors. the lawyers also accused the securities and exchange commission of censorship and of violating musk's first amendment rights by imposing a prior restraint on his speech. but the sec lawyers wrote that submitting statements for approval does not mean musk is prohibited from speaking. \"as long as a statement submitted for pre-approval is not false or misleading, tesla would presumably approve its publication without prior restraint on musk,\" they wrote. the sec also wrote that musk waived any first amendment challenge to the order when he agreed to it. musk's lawyers also argued that the sec's motion for contempt is an over-reach that exceeds its authority. but the sec said enforcement of the order is up to the judge, who has broad powers to enforce court orders. monday's filing said the feb. 19 tweet was different from prior public disclosures by the company. also, musk has regularly published tweets with \"substantive information\" about the company and its business, the sec contended. musk's 13-word feb. 19 tweet said that tesla would produce around 500,000 vehicles this year, but it wasn't approved by the company's \"disclosure counsel,\" the sec has said. the lawyer quickly realized it and summoned musk to the company's fremont, california, factory to help write a correction. the company would make vehicles at a rate of 500,000 per year, but it wouldn't produce a half-million in 2019. musk's response by former enron prosecutor john c. hueston of newport beach, california, said that the settlement allows musk \"reasonable discretion\" to determine if his communications would require the lawyer's approval. in the case of the feb. 19 tweet, musk determined that it did not. legal experts say it's unlikely that musk will be punished severely, but the commission wants to get on the record that musk violated the terms, to prepare for any future violations. the tweet was posted and corrected after u.s. markets had closed, but experts say regulators don't care much about that because stocks are traded nearly around the clock. tesla's stock rose by just $1.10, or less than 1 percent, the next day.",

(tesla). musk has previously said the truck's styling was inspired by the 1982 science fiction classic, and that it is the future vehicle he is most excited about. he tweeted last year that it will seat six passengers, \"definitely\" have a range of 400 to 500 miles, dual-motor all-wheel-drive and a self-leveling suspension. he also told recode that it will feature a \"lot of titanium,\" which is an uncommon material for mainstream vehicles, and that he doesn't know if a lot of people will buy it, but that a more conventional model could follow. as for when we'll see the rest of it, musk said during the company's earnings call in january that he might be ready to show it in full this summer, but production is likely several years away. by then, amazon-backed startup rivan plans to be selling an electric pickup called the r1t with similar specifications to tesla's truck.",

(ap). tesla ceo elon musk should not be found in contempt of court because he has complied with the terms of a securities fraud settlement, his attorneys wrote in documents filed monday night with the u.s. district court in manhattan. musk's lawyers wrote that a feb. 19 tweet merely restated prior disclosures on electric car production volumes. they wrote that the tweet after the markets closed did not reveal material information, nor did it alter the mix of data available to investors. the lawyers also accused the securities and exchange commission of censorship and of violating musk's first amendment rights. tesla launches '1,000 mph' charging station for model 3. u.s. district judge alison nathan ordered musk to respond to a motion for contempt filed by the sec. the agency alleges the feb. 19 tweet was inaccurate and violated a requirement for tweets that could influence tesla's stock price to be approved by a company lawyer. musk's 13-word feb. 19 tweet said that tesla would produce around 500,000 vehicles this year, but it wasn't approved by the company's \"disclosure counsel,\" the sec said in court records. the lawyer quickly realized it and summoned musk to the company's fremont, california, factory to help write a correction four hours later. the company would make vehicles at a rate of 500,000 per year, but it wouldn't produce a half-million in 2019. the response by musk attorney and enron prosecutor john c. hueston of newport beach, california, also said that the settlement allows musk \"reasonable discretion\" to determine if his communications would require the lawyer's approval. in the case of the feb. 19 tweet, musk determined that it did not. musk, the document stated, has diligently complied with the court-approved settlement, dramatically reducing his activity on twitter. even though in his view there was no need to do it, musk posted a clarification to the tweet after speaking with the lawyer, the paperwork said. the sec's interpretation of the order also raises serious first amendment issues \"effectively requiring musk to seek pre-approval of any tweet that relates to tesla,\" according to the documents. the lawyers also wrote that the sec is seeking enforcement authority that is far broader and less clearly defined than it was granted by congress. the contempt motion, which came after musk criticized the agency in an interview on cbs' \"60 minutes,\" shows \"concerning and unprecedented overreach on the part of the sec,\" the lawyers wrote. musk said during the interview that he didn't respect the sec, but he would obey the settlement out of respect for the justice system. the sec cited the interview in its contempt motion, which \"smacks of retaliation and censorship,\" musk's lawyers wrote. messages were left after business hours monday seeking comment from the sec. it was unclear monday night when judge nathan would rule on the sec's contempt motion, which was filed on feb. 25. the october settlement stemmed from tweets by musk in august about having the money to take the company private at $420 per share. the funding was far from secured. the settlement specified governance changes, including musk's ouster as board chairman, as well approval of musk's tweets. musk and tesla each paid $20-million fines for the august tweets, which musk made from his car on the way to the airport. at 7:15 p.m. feb. 19, musk tweeted \"tesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019.\" that turned out to be in error, and it wasn't consistent with prior company disclosures. in its fourth-quarter earnings release on jan. 30, tesla said it was targeting annualized model 3 output \"in excess of 500,000 units\" sometime between the fourth quarter of this year and second quarter of 2020. musk did say on a conference call that day that the company this year would make maybe 350,000 to 500,000 model 3s, its lowest-priced car. legal experts say it's unlikely that musk will be punished severely, but the commission wants to get on the record that musk violated the terms, to prepare for any future violations. the tweet was posted and corrected after u.s. markets had closed, but experts say regulators don't care much about that because stocks are traded nearly around the clock. tesla's stock rose by just $1.10, or less than 1 percent, the next day.",

after major setbacks in other cities. las vegas' tourism agency announced wednesday it is recommending that an enterprise backed by the divisive billionaire receive a contract to build and operate an underground tunnel system through which autonomous electric vehicles would whisk people around a mega convention center, and in the future, possibly the city's famous casino-filled corridor. autonomous shuttles have been proposed for the system.\n      (ap). if approved, the system of just over a mile long would debut by january 2021 at the facility, which hosts more than 1 million people every year. the musk-owned the boring company would build the project costing from $35 million to $55 million. the boring company unveils high-speed underground transportation system. it's different from his beleaguered efforts to build underground tunnel systems in other cities because musk will be paid for it if the contract is approved. projects in los angeles and chicago have drawn opposition and skepticism from residents and officials about whether they will actually open. musk has faced recent blowback because of his behavior and tweeting habits. he has had dust-ups with stock market regulators and agreed last year to step down as chairman of the board of tesla, his electric car company. but las vegas tourism officials are ready to get on board with a musk project. \"it's really innovative. i think it will be an attraction in and of itself, frankly,\" steve hill, president and ceo of the las vegas convention and visitors authority, told the associated press. the loop will be incorporated into an expanded convention center complex.\n      (ap). details of the project have not been finalized. but hill said the system will probably have three or four stations, each situated at entrances to the convention center's halls. people would be carried to the hall of their choice in electric vehicles moving through parallel tunnels, each running in one direction. the fleet could include tesla's model x and model 3 and a vehicle with capacity for about 16 people, hill said. all vehicles would be fully autonomous, meaning they won't have backup human drivers. the las vegas convention center, which attracts worldwide gatherings including the premier consumer electronics show, is undergoing an expansion. when finished, convention attendees could log about two miles walking from one end to the other. the distance led officials to look for a transportation solution. the service within the convention center is expected to be free for people attending events. the convention center is operated by the authority, which is funded by a county room tax and is responsible for promoting the destination around the world. the tourism agency is governed by a board of directors. the authority is expected to present to the board the recommendation to select musk's company march 12. if approved, hill said the agency hopes to return to the board with a full design and proposed contract by june. musk in december unveiled a test tunnel built under a los angeles suburb, allowing reporters and guests to take rides. it came almost two years to the day after musk announced on twitter that \"traffic is driving me nuts\" and he was \"going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging.\". \"i am actually going to do this,\" he added in response to initial skepticism. soon after, he began the boring company, tongue in cheek intentional. the skepticism has not subsided. the boring company in november canceled its plans for another test tunnel in the los angeles area after a neighborhood group filed a lawsuit over concerns about traffic and disruptions from trucks hauling out dirt during the boring process. now plans for a project in chicago appear to be in jeopardy. neither mayoral candidate approves of plans announced in june that called for a system similar to the one proposed for las vegas. it would carry people between chicago's downtown and o'hare international airport at speeds of up to 150 mph through underground tunnels. feds investigating fatal tesla model 3 crash in florida. hill said he does not expect permitting processes in the las vegas area to put the project behind schedule should it be approved, because the city is \"committed to innovation.\". \"look at everything that we have built in las vegas, and this city and everybody who has built it found ways to make that happen,\" he said. \"as long as this continues to make sense, i believe that we will figure out how to make it happen.\". hill acknowledged the technology that will be used in the project has not been used commercially, but he said the company has the talent to make the project a reality. the confidence in the boring company is such that the authority already has optional routes for the tunnel system to expand to connect to the las vegas strip, the city's downtown and mccarran international airport. an expansion of that magnitude could be a solution to the congestion affecting the strip and nearby areas. \"we do see it as a real opportunity and something we would like to pursue,\" hill said. steve davis, president of the boring company, said the speed at which the vehicles will move inside the convention center's tunnels will depend on the number of stations built. the technology involved in the project is being tested every day in the tunnel in hawthorne, california, he said. the company believes it will be able to deliver the project by the 2021 deadline, just before that year's edition of the ces tech gadget gathering. it is also eyeing the expansion possibility. \"if the community likes it, and they come, they ride at the convention center and they say 'this is great. it's comfortable. it's fast. it's awesome.' well, there are other places it can go,\" davis said.",

            "body": "tesla goes on offensive, burns competitors with 'extremely important metric'. (getty). without naming them outright, tesla took direct shots at jaguar and audi in its third-quarter earnings report on wednesday. up until now, the most talked about electric car benchmark has been how far one can go on a single charge, with battery size being the main determining factor, and automakers have raced to pack their packs with as many pricey cells as possible. tesla has been tops in this regard, with some models boasting 100 kilowatt-hours of power. what hasn't gotten a lot of play is how efficiently the cars use that electricity since it's generally much cheaper than gas, or even free in the case of tesla's supercharger network. but the epa does give electric vehicles a rating known as mpge, which is short for \"miles per gallon equivalent.\" in tesla's case, the all-wheel-drive model 3 is listed at 116 mpge, while the cheapest version of the model x suv comes in at 93 mpge. (tesla). in its third quarter investor update letter, tesla called this \"an extremely important metric as it allows an ev to reach a long epa range even when using a relatively small, inexpensive battery pack,\" and mentioned how its all-wheel-drive cars are significantly more efficient than their current and upcoming competition. at the moment, that is restricted to the recently released jaguar i-pace, which has an epa combined rating of just 76 mpge and gets 234 miles out of its 90 kwh battery. for comparison, the no-longer-produced, much larger and heavier model x with the same size battery was rated at 92 mpge and had a 257-mile range, while the current 75 kwh version is listed at 93 mpge with a 238-mile range. tesla clearly holds a significant advantage in power management, and should continue to do so through next year when the audi e-tron suv, which is similar in size to the i-pace, joins the fray with a 95 kwh pack and a range that's likely to be less than 250 miles. musk elaborated on the subject during the earnings report conference call, bringing it up after none of the analysts or journalists asked about it. musk told them that not only are tesla's powertrains the most efficient, but its batteries are also cheaper to produce. he then chided the legacy automakers for not investing more in their technology or collaborating with tesla when the opportunity was offered. not content with winning on these points, the tesla report added that the performance version of the model 3 is the quickest and fastest all-wheel-drive electric car on sale today. its 0-60 mph time of 3.3 seconds and 155 mph top speed are both significantly better than the i-pace's 4.5-second and 124 mph marks, although there are plenty of apples and oranges here because the model 3 is a sedan and the i-pace is an suv. nevertheless, tesla has set a new target for others to aim at, and it hit it right in the bullseye, of course.",

            "body": "tesla reveals its cheapest model 3 yet, puts confusing full-self driving option on hiatus. (tesla). tesla has reshuffled its model 3 lineup and is now offering the cheapest version yet, but it's still $10,000 more than the long-promised $35,000 entry-level car. the automaker is replacing the long-range battery in the rear-wheel-drive version of the compact sedan that retailed for $49,000 with a mid-range battery that drops the starting price to $45,000 and the range from 310 miles to 260 miles. (tesla). the cost includes a mandatory premium interior and audio package and the only functional option available is tesla's autopilot system, which is $5,000. the long-range rear-wheel-drive car will be available \"off menu\" for several days. in addition to these changes, tesla is temporarily removing the $3,000 full self-driving option from all of its models, which it said prepared them for autonomous driving capability when the software is available to make it work. company ceo elon musk said the option \"was causing too much confusion,\" and on tuesday revealed that a required upgrade to a tesla-designed computer chip for the system is still about six months away. this will be provided for free to customers who already paid for full self-driving. tesla has not said if customers who have already purchased cars with the option will be offered any type of compensation. and while tesla said last week that only cars ordered by oct. 15 would be guaranteed delivery before the end of 2018, when the available federal tax credit for their purchase drops from $7,500 to $3,750, the model 3 ordering website says that deliveries of the mid-range versions are possible within six to 10 weeks, which would get some in before the deadline.",

            "body": "tesla buys land in shanghai, china for factory. tesla's nevada gigafactory will be the largest building in the world when it is complete. (tesla). electric auto brand tesla inc. said it signed an agreement wednesday to secure land in shanghai for its first factory outside the united states, pushing ahead with development despite mounting u.s.-chinese trade tensions. tesla, based in palo alto, california, announced plans for the shanghai factory in july after the chinese government said it would end restrictions on full foreign ownership of electric vehicle makers to speed up industry development. those plans have gone ahead despite tariff hikes by washington and beijing on billions of dollars of each other's goods in a dispute over chinese technology policy. u.s. imports targeted by beijing's penalties include electric cars. china is the biggest global electric vehicle market and tesla's second-largest after the united states. tesla joins global automakers including general motors co., volkswagen ag and nissan motor corp. that are pouring billions of dollars into manufacturing electric vehicles in china. local production would eliminate risks from tariffs and other import controls. it would help tesla develop parts suppliers to support after service and make its vehicles more appealing to mainstream chinese buyers. tesla said it signed a \"land transfer agreement\" on a 210-acre site in the lingang district in southeastern shanghai. that is \"an important milestone for what will be our next advanced, sustainably developed manufacturing site,\" tesla's vice president of worldwide sales, robin ren, said in a statement. shanghai is a center of china's auto industry and home to state-owned shanghai automotive industries corp., the main local manufacturer for gm and vw. tesla said earlier that production in shanghai would begin two to three years after construction of the factory begins and eventually increase to 500,000 vehicles annually. tesla has yet to say how it will pay for the shanghai factory. the company has yet to give a price tag but the shanghai government said it would be the biggest foreign investment there to date. tesla's $5 billion nevada battery factory was financed with help from a $1.6 billion investment by battery maker panasonic corp. analysts expect tesla to report a loss of about $200 million for the three months ending sept. 30 following the previous quarter's $742.7 million loss. its ceo elon musk said in a sept. 30 letter to u.s. securities regulators that the company is \"very close to achieving profitability.\". tesla's estimated sales in china of under 15,000 vehicles in 2017 gave it a market share of less than 3 percent. the company faces competition from chinese brands including byd auto and baic group that already sell tens of thousands of hybrid and pure-electric sedans and suvs annually. until now, foreign automakers that wanted to manufacture in china were required to work through state-owned partners. foreign brands balked at bringing electric vehicle technology into china to avoid having to share it with potential future competitors. the first of the new electric models being developed by global automakers to hit the market, nissan's sylphy zero emission, began rolling off a production line in southern china in august. lower-priced electric models from gm, volkswagen and other global brands are due to hit the market starting this year, well before tesla is up and running in shanghai.",

            "body": "elon musk says saudi arabia's sovereign wealth fund may help take tesla private. saudi arabia's sovereign wealth fund would be the main source of money for tesla ceo elon musk's grand plan to take the company private, but the deal isn't done yet, musk disclosed in a blog on monday. the fund approached musk about going private multiple times during the past two years, and musk says he left a july 31 meeting with no question that the deal could be closed. that's why he tweeted on aug. 7 that he had \"funding secured\" to take the company private. it is that phrase that may lead to trouble for musk. if the tweet is deemed by regulators to be a factual statement, and it was taken as such by investors who drove shares up 11 percent on that day, musk could be at risk for securities fraud if it wasn't entirely true. already there are reports that the u.s. securities and exchange commission is looking into musk's tweet. funding for the deal would come from the ultraconservative kingdom's public investment fund, one of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds. founded in 1971, the fund has some $250 billion in investments across the world, according to the sovereign wealth fund institute, based in las vegas. among its holdings include a $3.5 billion stake in the ride-sharing app uber. a fund spokesman declined to comment monday night in riyadh. musk's blog , posted before the markets opened monday, didn't impress investors much. shares fell $3.10 to $352.39 in midday trading. under his proposal, only investors who don't want to remain with a private company would be paid, and funding for the deal would come from tesla stock, not debt. musk wrote that he expects about one-third of shareholders to take an offer of $420 per share, making the buyouts worth roughly $23.6 billion. presumably the wealth fund and perhaps other investors would put up the money to buy the shares and would be repaid in tesla equity. musk wrote that at the july 31 meeting, the fund's managing director \"strongly expressed his support\" for taking the electric car and solar panel maker private. \"i understood from him that no other decision makers were needed and that they were eager to proceed,\" musk wrote in the blog. but the deal appeared to be far from finished. since the meeting, the men have continued discussions and the managing director has expressed support \"subject to financial and other due diligence and their internal review process for obtaining approvals,\" musk wrote. the wealth fund recently bought nearly 5 percent of tesla's shares. the fund's chairman is saudi arabia's assertive 32-year-old crown prince mohammed bin salman. he has used the fund as a vehicle to achieve economic goals of increasing employment in the kingdom, as well as for floating a possible public offering of the state oil giant saudi aramco, though that effort appears to have stalled. tesla has a growing following on the arabian peninsula, with a glittering new showroom in the skyscraper-studded city of dubai in the united arab emirates. musk has visited the region as well and given talks. musk wrote in monday's blog that he made the aug. 7 announcement because he had talked to large investors about his desire to take the company private. \"it wouldn't be right to share information about going private with just our largest investors without sharing the same information with all investors at the same time,\" he wrote. he wrote that he was speaking for himself as a potential bidder for the company. musk also wrote that the saudis are interested in the company because they want to diversify away from oil. musk continues to speak with other investors because he wants tesla to continue to have a \"broad investor base,\" he wrote. tesla wouldn't comment on a possible sec investigation or why it took a week for details to be released in the blog. the sec also would not comment monday. late on friday, musk used twitter to taunt investors who have bet against his company, despite the possible sec investigation. the tweets were aimed at \"shorts,\" or investors who borrow shares of tesla and immediately sell them with the hope that tesla's share price will fall. that allows the shorts to buy back the stock at a lower price, return the shares to the lender, and pocket the difference. on friday, two lawsuits were filed accusing musk of seeking to harm short sellers by artificially running up the price of the company's shares. by taking tesla private, musk believes that the company will be able to sharpen its long-term focus of revolutionizing an automobile industry dominated by fuel-combustion vehicles without having to cater to investors' fixation on how the business is faring each quarter. ____. jon gambrell in dubai and marcy gordon in washington, d.c., contributed to this report.",

(the boring company). the company has designed a system that uses computer-controlled electric-powered wheeled \"skates\" that can travel at speeds of up to 150 mph while carrying passengers, goods or vehicles riding on top of them. the chicago express loop will initially feature skates outfitted as 16-passenger shuttles that will complete the 18-mile run between the airport and a new station to be built near the city's millennium park in 12 minutes, compared to approximately 45 minutes for the blue line surface train that services the route today. prices for the express service have not been set, but the boring company's proposal said that they'll be more expensive than the blue line, but cheaper than a car service. a source told the chicago tribune that the target is in the $20 to $25 range. musk has proposed a similar airport connector for los angeles, and has promised to offer rides in the test tunnel sometime this year. construction and final deal details between chicago and the boring company still need to be ironed out, but the tribune reports that the project will cost less than $1 billion. that price tag would be significantly lower than recent subways built in the united states, which have cost from $600 million to over $2 billion per mile.",

(ap photo/stephan savoia) (ap). tesla ceo elon musk took a conciliatory tone while responding to a consumer reports review that faulted the braking performance of his company's model 3 sedan, tweeting that the issue can be \"fixed.\". consumer reports found the average braking distance of two model 3s that it recently tested to be much longer than the company's claims, or those of any comparable cars. a ford f-150 pickup even took 7 feet less to brake from 60 to 0 mph in the same test. the publication described the problem as a \"weird\" inconsistency in the car's results. musk tweeted that it \"looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update\" to the anti-lock braking system calibration, which would be distributed as an over-the-air update to its connected cars within a few days. \"with further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. tesla won't stop until model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car,\" musk said. (tesla model 3). \"cr is pleased that tesla is taking our braking test results seriously, consumer reports director of automotive testing jake fisher told fox news. \"if tesla can update the brakes over the air -- an industry first -- we'd be happy to retest our model 3.\". consumer reports also said the model 3 came up short on ride quality and noise, prompting musk to point out that the vehicle the publication evaluated was an \"early production car\" and that both traits have since been improved in more recent builds. navigant research senior analyst samuel abuelsamid said that the test results were evidence of shortcuts tesla takes during development, compared to legacy automakers, and its willingness to send out unfinished cars that often require inconvenient follow-up work for updates and warranty work. \"affluent early adopters may be willing to tolerate this, but most mainstream customers can't afford to waste so much time. also other road users did not agree to be part of tesla's ongoing development process and they are being put at risk without informed consent,\" he said. in one of a long series of tweets addressing the consumer reports issue, musk thanked tesla supporters and wrote, \"i damn well love you.\". he also said the company \"might\" be able to increase the power output for the upcoming performance version of the model 3 announced on sunday, which he said will accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds and cost $83,000, fully loaded. this story has been updated with comment from consumer reports.",

(tesla). musk added that deliveries of model 3s with a 310 mile range and all-wheel-drive are set to begin in july. this dual motor option will add $5,000 to the $44,000 base price of cars with the long range battery pack, which are the only ones offered today. the performance version will have that range and the ability to accelerate from 0-60 mph in 3.5 seconds on the way to a 155 mph top speed. musk said it will handle better than a bmw m3 and \"beat anything else in its class on the track.\".",

            "body": "ntsb removes tesla from crash investigation, but company says it quit. federal investigators say they have booted electric car maker tesla inc. from a group that's investigating a fatal crash in california that involved an suv using the company's autopilot system. the national transportation safety board said it removed tesla as a party to the investigation after the company prematurely made information public. \"tesla violated the party agreement by releasing investigative information before it was vetted and confirmed by the ntsb,\" the agency said in a statement. \"such releases of incomplete information often lead to speculation and incorrect assumptions about the probable cause of a crash.\". tesla, however, disputed the claim and said it withdrew from the agreement two days earlier, after being told that it would be removed if it made additional statements before the ntsb finished its probe in the next 12 to 24 months. the company said it released information to correct \"misleading\" claims being made about autopilot creating safety problems. in a statement about the escalating dispute, tesla said it would file a complaint with congress and accused the ntsb of being more concerned with \"press headlines\" than promoting safety. removing a party to an investigation is rare but has happened in the past, according to the agency. companies and other organizations can become parties in a probe because they can give technical help and share sensitive information. the move means that the ntsb will no longer share information about the march 23 crash of a tesla model x suv on u.s. 101 near mountain view in silicon valley. the driver, walter huang, 38, a software engineer for apple, was killed in the crash. in a statement on march 30, tesla confirmed that the semi-autonomous autopilot system was operating at the time of the crash and seemed to blame the crash on huang. the company said huang didn't have his hands on the steering wheel for six seconds before the impact and also received several warnings from the vehicle. shortly after tesla released the information, an ntsb spokesman said the agency was \"unhappy\" about the disclosure. tesla tells drivers that its autopilot system - which uses cameras, radar and computers to keep speed, change lanes and automatically stop vehicles - requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel in order to take control to avoid accidents. the palo alto, california, company said its vehicle logs showed huang took no action to stop the model x from crashing into a concrete lane divider. the company said the crash was worsened by a missing or damaged safety shield on the end of the lane divider. the ntsb, along with the national highway traffic safety administration, is looking into the crash, as well as another tesla crash in january near los angeles in which a model s sedan smashed into a firetruck parked on a freeway. tesla would not say whether the model s in that crash was operating on autopilot. david friedman, a former nhtsa acting administrator who now is director of cars and product policy for consumers union, the advocacy arm of consumer reports, said the tesla-ntsb spat could delay the investigation if the agency doesn't have all the electronic information it needs from the company. the agency has legal options if tesla isn't forthcoming, he said, but those take time and taxpayer dollars. the ntsb, he said, has never been focused on publicity, and it has the authority to investigate new technology like autopilot. \"if anything, the ntsb is shining a spotlight on tesla because of their innovation,\" friedman said. consumers union has called for tesla to stop testing the cars with its buyers, and friedman said the company shouldn't use the name autopilot because it implies that the cars can drive themselves. \"you should name it so that it is clear what it can and can't do,\" he said. in the crash that killed huang, a tesla spokeswoman would not directly answer questions about why the suv didn't spot the freeway barrier and stop before the collision. the spokeswoman referred to a statement saying that tesla owners' manuals have warnings and notifications stating that a driver should not depend on the car's autosteer system to pick the right driving path. it also says automatic emergency braking \"is not designed to avoid a collision and is not a substitute for maintaining a safe traveling distance\" from other vehicles. in its statement thursday, tesla accused the ntsb of focusing on the \"safest cars in america\" while ignoring less-safe vehicles. tesla says there is one auto death in the u.s. for every 86 million miles driven, but for tesla vehicles, it's one death for every 320 million miles. the ntsb makes recommendations to prevent crashes, while nhtsa has authority to fine automakers, push for recalls and seek regulations.",

        "body": {
            "body": "will your smartphone replace your car key?. the new tesla model 3 has lots of eye-opening features that distinguish this fully-electric car from other hybrid and electric vehicles, including a single touch screen that replaces the traditional dashboard full of buttons and displays. still, perhaps the first big difference many model 3 drivers will notice is this tesla's lack of a traditional key fob. that familiar feature-along with the door locks and start button-has essentially been replaced by the tesla smartphone app (shown at top). the model 3 can sense an authorized driver's smartphone from up to 30 feet away, turning a driver's smartphone into a virtual key, allowing him or her to set the model 3 doors (and even the trunk) to automatically unlock when approaching the car; the doors lock themselves when the driver walks away from the car. starting the model 3 is as simple as shifting out of park. but it could be a few years before other automakers widely adopt the virtual key, as car companies and smartphone manufacturers struggle to overcome some basic issues with the technology, according to industry suppliers and researchers cr spoke to. meanwhile, automakers and phone manufacturers are still working to collaborate on standards so that a software update or security breach on your smartphone doesn't render your virtual car key useless and your car undrivable. there's also the basic question of how well today's smartphone-as-car-key technology works. for instance, cr's testers found that the model 3's virtual key isn't always as convenient or as secure as a traditional key fob. (read about cr's test of the tesla model 3's virtual key.). despite the potential benefits of virtual keys-no key fob to carry or lose (and replace for a steep price), and the fact that you can lend someone your car just by granting access through an app-some experts think it's too soon to implement the technology widely. \"i think you want to be very careful before you roll out something radically different, [because] there may be a gap in security or convenience,\" says michael crane, head of vehicle body and security for the automotive supplier continental. the limitations of current virtual-key technology are among crane's top concerns. for instance, the model 3 virtual key relies on bluetooth low energy, or ble, to connect with the car. but ble doesn't work unless the phone is turned on and the tesla app is open and active on the phone. our testers occasionally found themselves unable to open the model 3's door when they had closed the app-the modern equivalent of fumbling for keys at the bottom of a purse. there are other drawbacks to virtual keys. what happens when your smartphone battery dies? can you still access and drive your car if you lose your phone? and what do you do when you leave your car with a parking attendant, say, in a public garage or at a venue with valet parking, or take it to a car wash?. the tesla keycard given those scenarios, tesla provides model 3 owners with a backup keycard (shown below) to carry in a purse or wallet. (the tesla model s and model x come with a regular key fob.). but the keycard isn't an ideal solution. to lock or unlock the car, a driver must must swipe the keycard along the pillar next to the driver's seat. the model 3 doesn't come with a traditional ignition switch or push-button start, so drivers must also tap the key behind the front-seat cup holders to \"start\" the car. neither spot is well-marked. imagine having to explain that routine every time someone borrows your car. there's also an issue with the smartphone itself: the lifespan of a car is far longer than that of any smartphone, so suppliers will have to work with phone manufacturers to ensure that their virtual-key technology remains compatible over the years. \"the next time i get an upgrade pushed to me by apple, i don't want my virtual key to be inoperative,\" crane says. that's why he expects most cars will still come with key fobs even if they offer a virtual key. automakers also have to be sure that a smartphone-based key is as secure as a traditional key fob, and that requires working with smartphone manufacturers. \"the security of the system is now relying on the security of your phone,\" says karl koscher, an automotive-security researcher at the university of california at san diego. for instance, it might be possible for hackers to access the virtual key of a car owner who has visited a malicious website or downloaded an app with malware. \"the good news is that smartphone makers generally patch known security flaws with software updates more often than automakers fix faulty hardware,\" koscher says. however, software updates can't yet fix some inherent flaws in current smartphone-as-car-key technology, which could make it easy for the wrong person to get access to a vehicle. the traditional keyless entry fobs used by most cars today rely on rf (radio frequency) technology, which sends a radio signal to a receiver inside the car that can determine the location of the key. in most cases, drivers can't start the car unless the key is inside the vehicle. \"within millimeters, we know whether that key is inside or outside the car,\" crane said. however, the latest smartphone-based keys use different technology. the model 3's ble setup can anticipate a driver's arrival and unlock the car from a distance of up to 30 feet, which is shorter than a traditional rf keyfob's range. at closer range, the vehicle can't determine whether the key is inside or outside the car. that means there's a greater risk of the vehicle being stolen as the owner approaches or for a child to start the car while a parent is just outside the vehicle. we left a smartphone equipped with the tesla virtual-key app 5 feet outside the driver's door of our test vehicle and attempted to start the car. even though the phone wasn't inside the model 3, we were able to start it and drive away. (the car would not start when the phone was more than 5 feet away.). during a 10-mile trip without the phone or the backup keycard, no messages on the car's display warned us that the key was not in the vehicle, and the tesla app didn't display any notifications that the car had been driven away. that's in contrast to what we've seen with other cars. nearly every vehicle we've tested will warn the driver if the car is running but the key is absent. for instance, when we tried the same test with a 2018 mazda cx-5 and a 2018 ford expedition-both equipped with a traditional key fob-we couldn't start either vehicle when the fob was more than a half-inch outside the driver's door. we also tested a 2018 chevrolet bolt equipped with gm's keypass ble-based virtual key. although the app let us unlock the doors, the system still required a key fob to be present for the car to start. tesla says that it has plans to improve the accuracy of its ble-based system. the company is also rolling out a software update for its virtual-key function so it unlocks the doors when any handle is pulled and opens the trunk when the button on the lid is pushed. despite issues with smartphone-as-car-key technology, automakers are still moving forward. mercedes-benz has offered a phone-based key for the european version of the e-class since 2016. a similar option will be available on the european version of the 2019 audi a6, although it will be compatible only with android phones. both systems use near field communication (nfc) to operate. unlike ble, nfc works even if a phone's battery is dead. (nfc lacks the range of ble or a traditional rf key fob, so the driver must hold the phone against the door handle to unlock the car and place the phone in a specific spot on the dashboard to start the car.). other automakers are getting in on the action. the lincoln way app for the lincoln aviator, for instance, will mimic such traditional key-fob functions as unlock and chirp, and it can even store driver profiles for various comfort settings. should the phone battery die, the driver can still access the suv using an exterior keypad. this decades-old ford/lincoln feature handily gets around concerns raised for other systems. zipcar currently allows app-based access to its rental vehicles, and some traditional rental-car companies in the u.s. are also pilot-testing app-based access so drivers can check in on their phones and get going without a trip to the counter. tesla has said that its virtual keys will help drivers share their model 3s with other drivers using the company's own ride-sharing platform. although tesla is the first automaker in the u.s. to offer smartphone-as-car-key technology, crane is confident that similar systems will roll out in most cars over the next decade, starting with luxury vehicles. \"i'm absolutely convinced you will see this trickle down from the top, from the premium segment,\" he says, as have many advanced technologies over the years. consumer reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer, and healthier world. cr does not endorse products or services, and does not accept advertising. copyright \u00a9 2018, consumer reports, inc.",

            "body": "tesla has doubled price to use some of its supercharging stations. tesla's superchargers can recharge one of its car's batteries to 80 percent in as little as 40 minutes. (tesla). tesla has raised the rates at its proprietary supercharger stations as production of its lower-cost model 3 sedan ramps up. the electrek blog first noticed the adjustment, reporting that prices jumped this week between 20 percent and 100 percent, depending on the state. for example, oregon saw an increase from 12 cents to 24 cents per kilowatt-hour, while the rate in new york was hiked from 19 cents to 24 cents. superchargers are located strategically along highways and in urban areas.\n      (tesla). due to electricity distribution regulations, a per-minute fee is charged in some states like alabama, where prices are linked to the charging speed. the fastest charges there cost 20 cents per minute, while slower ones are priced at half that rate. for the first few years that they were on sale, all teslas were offered with a lifetime of free supercharging, but now the high end model s and x come with a credit for only 400 kilowatt-hours of supercharging annually, while the entry-level model 3 is pay as you go from the start. a referral program exists for current model s and x owners to give new buyers lifetime free charging, but it does not applly to the model 3. elon musk's very rapid transportation system will feature 150 mph buses. \"we occasionally adjust rates to reflect current local electricity and usage. the overriding principle is that supercharging will always remain significantly cheaper than gasoline, as we only aim to recover a portion of our costs while setting up a fair system for everyone,\" a tesla spokesperson told electrek, adding that \"this will never be a profit center for tesla.\". based on the new rates, a model 3 recharged at a supercharging station in new york would cost $6.24 to drive 100 miles, or around $936 annually for an average owner driving 15,000 miles per year, according to its epa fuel economy rating. the gas for a similarly sized and priced cadillac ats would be $10.50 for 100 miles, or $1,527 annually. tesla expects most owners to do the majority of their charging at home, while the superchargers are strategically located to facilitate long trips. are you following fox news autos on facebook?.",

            "body": "tesla's new electric semi truck makes its debut delivery. tesla semi (tesla). tesla caused quite a stir with its all-electric semi truck when it unveiled the vehicle in november. boasting 0 to 60 mph in a zippy five seconds (sans trailer) and a range of 500 miles, as well as autonomous driving features and a design unlike any truck that's gone before, tesla ceo elon musk hopes the tesla semi will one day transform the long-haul trucking industry. on wednesday, musk posted a photo showing a couple of the trucks embarking on their first-ever delivery run. the ride, which involves transporting battery packs between two tesla facilities, covers a round-trip distance of just under 500 miles, so it could complete the trip on a single charge. \"first production cargo trip of the tesla semi heavy duty truck, carrying battery packs from the gigafactory in the nevada mountains to the car factory in california,\" the ceo wrote in a message posted on instagram. tesla is aiming to sell the truck to shipping firms starting in 2019, but initially, while it tests and refines the vehicle, it'll run its own operation consisting of rides similar to wednesday's effort. the truck with the 500-mile range is expected to cost from $180,000, while a 300-mile model will start at $150,000. there'll also be a limited edition \"founders series\" - a thousand will be produced - starting at around $200,000 each. news of the truck's first outing comes a few weeks after we heard about the company's apparent plans for a vital part of the platform's infrastructure: charging stations. according to reuters, tesla is working with early customers of its electric semi truck - among them anheuser-busch, pepsico, and the united parcel service - to build the charging stations on their own sites. the report said some of the companies are exploring the idea of sharing the charging facilities with one another for efficiency and cost savings. and just like the supercharger stations for its cars, tesla is also believed to be making plans for its own facilities along highways to sell electricity to truckers looking for a top-up. tesla's entry into the trucking business comes as a number of new players look to shake up the industry. this week, for example, we learned that uber recently started delivering freight in arizona using its autonomous truck, while waymo and others are also investing heavily in the development of their own self-driving trucks.",

(remetzcar). in the announcement, the company said ares ceo dany bahar got the idea for a model s shooting brake after daily driving a model s sedan. although he appreciated the car, he felt it lacked more usable cargo space and didn't care for the interior's fit and finish. now, the company will address both of the executive's concerns. (qwest). ares will construct the shooting brake with aluminum and carbon fiber, two elements ares knows quite very well. at current, the model s is stripped down in preparation for new panels and ares leather specialists are hard at work on new trimmings for the interior. the company said it does not plan to alter the electric powertrain, however, unlike some of ares' other conversions. the firm will also be hard at work on 412-inspired conversion for the ferrari gtc4 lusso, which it announced on wednesday. ares expects the model s shooting brake to go on sale in early summer of this year, but the firm's conversion will come at a premium. pricing will hover around the $250,000 to $310,000 range. more auto news from motor authority.",

            "body": "ntsb investigating tesla crash allegedly involving 'autopilot'. a tesla rear-ended a fire truck parked to respond to an accident on i-405\rin culver city, calif. on jan. 22, 2018, according to the culver city fire\rdepartment and california highway patrol. (culver city firefighters local\r1927) (culver city firefighters local 1927). the u.s. government has sent two investigators to collect evidence from an an accident involving a tesla model s that was allegedy operating in its 'autopilot' mode when it crashed into the back of a parked fire truck on monday in culver city, california. the national transportation safety board said on twitter that the team will be focusing on driver and vehicle factors. the accident took place in broad daylight on interstate 405 when the tesla rear-ended the fire truck, which was responding to a previous incident. witnesses estimate that the car was traveling at 65 mph at the time of the collision and that the driver said autopilot was activated. this is the second time the ntsb has looked into a crash involving tesla's autopilot feature, which is a driver assist system with limited semi-autonomous capabilities. the ntsb in september determined that design limitations of the tesla model s autopilot played a major role in a may 2016 fatal crash in florida involving a vehicle operating under autopilot. but it blamed the crash on an inattentive tesla driver's overreliance on technology and a truck driver who made a left turn in front of the car. the california investigation comes as congress and federal agencies grapple with how to regulate autonomous vehicles and those with systems that are partially self-driving. the systems can significantly reduce crashes, but computer-driven vehicles also can make mistakes. tesla wouldn't say if autopilot was working at the time of the culver city crash, but said in a statement monday that drivers must stay attentive when it's in use. the company would not comment on the investigation. in monday's crash, the california highway patrol and the culver city fire department confirmed the southbound tesla hit the rear of the firetruck but could not confirm if autopilot was operating, the mercury news of san jose reported. the firetruck was parked in the left emergency and carpool lane with emergency lights flashing to block a previous crash on monday morning, culver city fire battalion chief ken powell told the newspaper. the tesla suffered significant damage, but the driver showed no significant injuries, powell said. the model s autopilot is a level 2 on a self-driving scale of 0 to 5. level 5 vehicles can operate autonomously in nearly all circumstances. level 2 automation systems are generally limited to use on interstate highways, which don't have intersections. autopilot keeps a vehicle centered in its lane at a set distance from cars in front of it. it also can change lanes and brake automatically. drivers are supposed to continuously monitor vehicle performance and be ready to take control if necessary. in the florida crash, which killed an ohio man driving the tesla, ntsb investigators found that the sedan's cameras and radar weren't capable of detecting a vehicle turning into its path. rather, the systems are designed to detect vehicles being followed to prevent rear-end collisions. the ntsb re-issued previous recommendations that the government require all new cars and trucks to be equipped with technology that wirelessly transmits the vehicles' location, speed, heading and other information to other vehicles in order to prevent collisions. (joshua brown was killed in florida in 2016 when he and his tesla's autopilot failed to detect a tractor trailer crossing the road in front of it.). the ntsb also recommended that automakers develop systems to make sure drivers pay attention while using semi-autonomous systems, other than detecting the pressure of hands on the steering wheel. the driver in the florida crash had his hands on the sedan's steering wheel for only 25 seconds out of the 37.5 minutes the vehicle's cruise control and lane-keeping systems were in use prior to the crash, investigators found. tesla has taken steps to prevent drivers from using autopilot improperly, including measuring the amount of torque applied to the steering wheel and sending visual and audio warnings. if the warnings are ignored, drivers would be prevented from using autopilot, the company has said. the national highway traffic safety administration, which regulates auto safety, declined last year to issue a recall or fine tesla as a result of the crash, but it warned automakers they aren't to treat semi-autonomous cars as if they were fully self-driving. the associated press contributed to this report.",

(tesla). tesla's big rig comes with a big up-front price. the electric automaker has revealed that its new semi starts at $150,000 for a model with a 300-mile range and $180,000 for a 500-mile version with a larger battery pack. the diesel trucks it will compete against when it hits the highway no earlier than 2019 go for approximately $100,000-$125,000 each, but tesla claims its semi will cost 20 percent less to own and operate. this is thanks in part to the low-cost charges it will provide at a network of \"megachargers\" and expected lower maintenance costs for its electric powertrain. a $20,000 deposit is required to purchase one, which is up from the $5,000 announced when the sleek semi was revealed on nov. 16th. however, if you want to be one of the first 1,000 in line for one you'll have to pony up $200,000 for a founder's series model that requires payment in full for a reservation. walmart, j.b. hunt and a handful of other companies have already announced plans to purchase a few of the trucks for evaluation, but tesla hasn't yet announced how many orders it has in hand. (tesla). along with the promise of emissions-free driving, the semi, which is fitted with four electric motors, also boasts superior acceleration to diesel trucks, a central driver's seat and is equipped with the cameras and sensors necessary to enable tesla's suite of semi-autonomous autopilot features.",

            "body": "the 2020 tesla roadster is an electrifying $200,000 speed machine. (tesla). tesla revealed its first semi-truck at an event in california on thursday night, but it was the cargo it was hauling that stole the show. ceo elon musk gave the world a surprise look at the successor to tesla's first car, the roadster, boasting that it will deliver a \"hardcore smackdown\" to gasoline-powered cars. (tesla). unlike the original, which was essentially a lotus elise that'd been converted to run on electricity, the new roadster is 100 percent tesla and promises performance figures unmatched in the history of street legal sports cars. (tesla). tesla claims the sleek 2+2 can accelerate to 60 mph in 1.9 seconds and cover a quarter-mile in 8.9. both figures would beat the world's quickest production cars by wide margins. musk also said it has a top speed \"above 250 mph\" that would make it one of the fastest street legal cars ever, adding that all of the specs are based on prototypes for the base model, suggesting better numbers to come. perhaps more impressive is how far it can go on a charge, an unprecedented 620 miles. that's courtesy of an enormous 200 kilowatt-hour battery pack and twice the capacity of the largest available in tesla's current cars. a pack that size would likely weigh over a ton using current technology, but it's possible that tesla is developing a lighter, more energy-dense battery. a removable roof panel can be stored in roadster's trunk, which musk says provides ample cargo room for the luggage needed for a long trip. the simple cabin design features a single display integrated into the center console, a race car-style rectangular steering wheel fitted with grips and two rear seats that aren't suitable for \"giant people,\" according to musk. (tesla). one example of the car on display also had a large windshield wiper that wasn't discussed in musk's presentation, but looks as if it may be articulated to move almost straight across the windshield, rather than in a constant arc, which would allow it to clear most of the glass area with each swipe. it's not the most elegant styling element, especially on a car that doesn't have visible side view mirrors or cameras. (reuters). tesla says that the roadster will be on the road by 2020 and has opened the order book for the car, which carries a starting price of $200,000. a $50,000 deposit is required to reserve one, but if you want to get to the front of the line you'll have to pony up a full $250,000 for one of the first 1,000 founder's series cars that will be the first off of the production line.",

            "body": "tesla pickup concept revealed, but is it for real?. tesla is serious about this truck thing. or maybe it's joking. during an event to unveil tesla's first semi-truck, and a $200,000 sports car, company ceo elon musk said that they also designed a pickup version of the semi that's so big it could carry a pickup. a sketch of the truck -- a monster two-axle rig with knobby tires, the streamlined front of the semi and a bed with, yes, a pickup inside of it -- was then shown on the screen behind him. the crowd cheered and giggled, but musk may have had the last laugh when he added \"you will actually be able to legally drive that with a normal driver's license. it's kind of wrong, but i like it.\". \"will\" being the key word. musk first promised in april that tesla would be revealing a pickup within 18-24 months, but it was widely expected to be a light duty truck like an f-150. it might still be, as he didn't actually say the semi-based pickup would ever go on sale. (international). but the idea of a mega pickup isn't too far-fetched. international built a line of them on its heavy duty truck chassis from 2004 to 2008 that it called the extreme truck, or xt, and it included a consumer version that was driven by shaquille o'neal and ashton kutcher. kutcher has since purchased several teslas, and some of the company's stock...so you never know. the 2020 tesla roadster is an electrifying $200,000 speed machine.",
